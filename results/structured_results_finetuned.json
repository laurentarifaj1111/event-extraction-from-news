    "original_text": "Pope Francis has said he is 'truly sorry' for offending large Catholic families by saying that there was no need to breed 'like rabbits'. The Pope caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right'. Vatican Archbishop Giovanni Becciu has apologised on Francis' behalf by saying 'the Pope is truly sorry' that his remarks about large families 'caused such disorientation'. Anger: Francis caused dismay among larger families last month when he cautioned 'responsible parenthood' advising that three children was 'about right' Archbishop Becciu told the Italian bishop's newspaper Avvenire that the pope 'absolutely did not want to disregard the beauty and the value of large families.' Francis, himself the eldest of five children, had told a press conference on a flight back from the Philippines how a woman he knows was pregnant with her eighth child after having the first seven by C section. Devout: Former U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum said it's sometimes difficult to listen to the Pope . He said he had rebuked her, saying: 'But do you want to leave seven orphans?' The Pope said: 'That is an irresponsibility. That woman might say 'no but I trust in God.' But God gives you methods to be responsible.' He added: 'Some think that in order to be good Catholics we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.' The remarks immediately provoked anger from pro life groups who said that they were hurtful to Catholic mothers who had sacrificed careers, time and energy to care for their children. Former US Republican Presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a devout Catholic, said: 'It's sometimes very difficult to listen to the Pope and some of the things he says off the cuff, and this is one of them.' The following Wednesday, Pope Francis attempted to repair some of the damage, telling his general audience in St Peter's Square: 'It gives me consolation and hope to see so many large families that welcome children as a true gift from God.' The remarks immediately provoked anger from pro life groups who said that they were hurtful to Catholic mothers .",

    "original_text": "CNN The thing about presidential elections, be it in Ukraine or anywhere else for that matter, is that it makes sense to ignore everything that was said during the election campaign and, especially, in the immediate aftermath. Election promises are made to be broken or ignored altogether remember \"Yes We Can?\" And in the first few days, or even weeks, after results are announced lots of things are said that mean pretty much nothing. To say that the presidential election campaign in Ukraine produced a lot of statements and pledges that made little or no sense would be an understatement. If you summarise them all, then Ukraine should be in fine shape to join the G7 group of industrialised nations, replacing Russia, in about five years' time. The election winner, confectionary billionaire Petro Poroshenko, and his nearest rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko the two have received 57 and 12 per cent of the votes respectively have promised to unite Ukraine, suppress the rebellion in the east, return Crimea grabbed by Russia, revive the country and put it smack at the heart of Europe while practically no one even bothered to contradict them. And even Darth Vader one of 17 candidates for the presidency, walking around in full Star Wars costume didn't really sound over the top compared to others. The whole point of the hastily arranged election in Ukraine was to get a \"legitimate\" president, of sorts, to emerge in Kiev, even if he would be the best of the worst, as someone said, and attempt to introduce some sense of normality in Ukraine which has been rocked by violence and upheaval since November last year after the then President Viktor Yanukovich walked away from a free association deal with the European Union, and was later ousted as a result. All the talk of a possible second round if no one won more than 50 per cent of the vote was obviously intended to put a bit of \"competitiveness\" into elections that were predetermined from the moment one of the favourites, former heavyweight boxer Vitaly Klitchko, stood down from the race, throwing his impressive weight behind Poroshenko. Not to mention the approval of his candidacy by Washington President Barack Obama's cover was blown when he congratulated the winner before the votes had been counted he really needs some coaching in the art of diplomacy. Announcing his victory late on Sunday, Poroshenko said all the things that he had been saying during his election campaign: That under his presidency Ukraine would be united, that the economy would grow, that the country was going to join Europe, that he was prepared to deal with Russia but would never accept the annexation of Crimea and the two referendums on independence that had been conducted in Donetsk and Lugansk regions in the east on May 11. Opinion: Will Ukraine's new president tame country's elite? In fact, the \"Candy Man\" as he was dubbed during the election campaign, said that the anti terrorist operation in the east against the anti Kiev rebels would be intensified, although hinted that it won't be running for months but would be wound up relatively quickly. If that wasn't a hint to Moscow that the soon to be crowned new leader was open to suggestion, then I don't what is. The big challenge that Poroshenko, a clever political operator who has managed to steer through troubled waters under four presidents, is facing comes from the mere fact of his victory. As of now, the buck stops with him and he will be held responsible for anything that happens in the country. That was why the cunning Tymoshenko, when she accepted defeat in the election, pointed out that her former opponent was now in charge and would be taking on the weight of responsibility. Tymoshenko still fares her chances of becoming president quite highly and, as I was informed, plans to highlight all the problems that Poroshenko would no doubt start encountering with gusto. Seasoned Ukraine watchers, who have slept through the current revolution in Kiev and failed to predict the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich in February, have now got a new spring in their step, pointing out that a lot would depend on how the Kremlin will play its cards and whether it would be serious in dealing with Poroshenko. Although Moscow has already signalled, on all levels, that it is prepared to give the new Ukrainian leader a chance, and a possible visit to Russia in June has already been mentioned. But, ironically, the biggest challenge facing Poroshenko in the next several months comes not from Russia or the so called separatists in the east but from Ukraine's very own oligarchs, who now see the newly elected president as a potential threat to their business empires. It was one thing when Poroshenko was just a candidate, but once that inauguration comes, he will have the power to not only to put financial pressure on the oligarchs but also to order their arrest and put them in prison for the many sins they have committed. And the example of Tymoshenko ending up in the slammer in the times of President Yanukovich must be still fresh in their minds. Make no mistake, the oligarchs with their vast wealth, their personal armies and their people in the government machine, the police and the intelligence services will not stay idle. The horse trading and the scratching of backs was going on ever since Poroshenko emerged as the favorite for the presidency. But that doesn't mean he can't be pragmatic and go back on his promises. And it sure doesn't mean that the rest will keep their word as well. Especially as some of the oligarchs actually prefer a situation of instability and uncertainty, as they thrive under such conditions and find it easier to jostle for power. So what can happen in the next year or so? Well, the parliamentary elections will obviously take place this year in Ukraine, with Poroshenko promising to \"see them through.\" The talks with Russia will commence very soon, if only to resolve the gas supply issue, but won't bring any dramatic results on most other subjects in the foreseeable future, with the prospect of Crimea coming back to the Ukrainian fold looking as likely as Joe Biden winning the next presidential election in the U.S. So the only realistic way out could be agreeing some sort of compensation, paid out by Russia to Ukraine, say something like 500 billion over a period of 10 years or more, in return for Kiev accepting the loss of the peninsula and the world recognising it as part of Russia. The resolution of the problem with the separatist Donetsk and Lugansk regions promises to be a thorny issue, but if Poroshenko and President Putin were able to negotiate a ceasefire in the next few weeks or so, this would be seen as a great achievement. And although Poroshenko is telling everyone that the idea of federalism and giving Donetsk and Lugansk greater autonomy is totally unacceptable to him, things, as has been pointed out above, do tend to change a lot after elections, so he might change his mind on this one as well. Finally, a lot will depend on whether the U.S. and the EU would actually allow Poroshenko some serious room for manoeuvre to deal with President Putin. If he is boxed in by the demands of his Western patrons to keep the pressure on Moscow high, then his chances of achieving anything will be quite slim and the other oligarchs might just be tempted to bring him down.

    "original_text": "CNN It may not be conclusive proof of climate change, but every couple of years brings another \"Ice Age\" to air conditioned multiplexes across the globe. Each of its predecessors made more money than the one that came before, so there's an inevitability about this fourth venture \"Ice Age: Continental Drift\" even if it bears telltale signs of creative exhaustion and, yes, drift. The franchise started out as a prehistoric, slapstick spin on the old John Ford western, \"Three Godfathers,\" with a woolly mammoth, a sloth and a sabre toothed tiger Manny, Sid and Diego, voiced by Ray Romano, John Leguizamo and Denis Leary delivering an orphaned human baby to safety. It has evolved or maybe \"devolved\" into a scrappy string of antic adventures interspersed with sitcom style character notes, all pegged to whatever novelty the writing team can contrive in place of a plot. In part three it was a subterranean dinosaur lair. In this episode, an unfortunate incident with an acorn at the earth's core precipitates tectonic realignment. When the continents part ways, Manny and the guys are trapped on an iceberg heading out to sea with only Sid's nutty grandmother Wanda Sykes for company. Manny's quest to be reunited with wife Ellie Queen Latifah and teen daughter Peaches Keke Palmer is interrupted by a gang of scurvy pirates, led by a tricorn headed orangutan, Captain Gutt Peter Dinklage . Whoever thought it was a good idea to spike this tired series with the defining component from a rival, equally over extended franchise not to mention the recent Aardman Animation pirate caper , well, here's a thought: maybe you could introduce a web slinging spider boy in the next one? You know, just to keep things fresh! The animation is dynamic and crisp, but the story just runs around in circles while we wait for the sky to fall down. Truth be told, it's a kick that Twentieth Century Fox is distributing a movie about the dangers of climate change. \"Doesn't it worry you that this is the end of the world?\" someone asks a particularly unintelligent couple of party hearty mammals. Uh uh, they respond. \"I guess we can tell you our secret... We're really, really stupid.\" Like the equally stretched to the breaking point \"Shrek\" series, \"Ice Age\" has accumulated too many characters with too little to do, and all star vocal stylings \"Continental Drift\" adds Jennifer Lopez, Drake, Nick Frost and even Joy Behar, to name a few can only do so much by way of compensation. A bigger problem: the trio of reprobates at the center of proceedings have become so domesticated over the years, whatever mild comic edge they used to have has been dulled to a soft nub. The loner, Manny, is now a boringly over bearing father. The aggressive Diego is just a big pussycat. Only pea brained Sid has stayed true to type, which will please infants more than their parents. For the record, everything I disliked about this movie the dumb teen mammoth romance subplot, the narwhal propelled iceberg, and especially the irritating Sid were selected as personal highlights by my 7 year old. As in the earlier films, the most enterprising comedy features the mute squirrel, Scrat, who's Looney Tunes inspired misadventures are almost always a welcome distraction even if we already saw too much of this material in teasers released last year. Better than any of this is the five minute 3D Simpsons short \"The Longest Daycare\" that precedes the feature. A starring vehicle for baby Maggie, this is sharp, witty visual slapstick that harks back to the silent era for inspiration. True to form, my kid hated it.",

    "original_text": "Reuters Maine police arrested a heavily armed man driving on the state turnpike who carried clippings about the cinema massacre in Colorado and claimed he attended the new \"Batman\" film with a loaded gun, authorities said on Monday. Timothy Courtois, 49, was driving 112 mph on the Maine Turnpike with an AK 47 assault weapon, four handguns and several boxes of ammunition in his car when state police pulled him over about 10 am on Sunday, said Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Steve McCausland. He told police that he was headed to Derry, New Hampshire to shoot a former employer, McCausland said in a statement. Courtois told police he had attended the new Batman movie, \"The Dark Knight,\" at a theater in Saco, Maine on Saturday night with a loaded gun in his backpack, he said. Police found clippings in his car about the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, where 12 people were killed and 58 wounded by a gunman at a Friday showing of \"The Dark Knight,\" he said. At Courtois' home in Biddeford, Maine, police found several additional guns, including a machine gun, and thousands of rounds of ammunition, he said. Courtois was slated to appear in court on Monday in Springvale District Court on initial charges of speeding and carrying a concealed weapon, McCausland said. Editing by Ellen Wulfhorst and Cynthia Osterman BIDDEFORD, Maine Maine State Police seized an arsenal of weapons from a Biddeford man who told police he brought a loaded gun to a showing of Batman: The Dark Knight Rises in Saco on Saturday night, according to Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland. Timothy Courtois, 49, was arrested in York about 10 a.m. Sunday after state police Trooper Phillip Alexander clocked Courtois Ford Mustang traveling at 112 mph on the Maine Turnpike. Other motorists had called police to report the vehicle was speeding southbound on the turnpike with its hazard lights flashing. Inside the car, police found an AK 47 assault rifle, four handguns and several boxes of ammunition, McCausland said Monday afternoon. Also in Courtois car, police found newspaper clippings about the mass shooting Friday during a showing of the same Batman movie at a Colorado movie theater, according to McCausland. Courtois told police he had attended the Batman movie at the Cinemagic Theater in Saco on Saturday night with a loaded gun in his backpack and that he was on his way Sunday to Derry, N.H., where he planned to shoot a former employer, McCausland said. He didn t speak to any intent to harm people at the theater , but I m sure a lot of this is going to continue to come out as agencies including the state police, FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives continue their investigations, Maine State Police Lt. Kevin Donovan said Monday. We don t know what his true intentions were when he brought the gun to the theater, and investigators are trying to determine his reasons for doing so and for having a large collection of firearms, McCausland said. New Hampshire based Cinemagic operates seven movie theaters in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. Bob Collins, director of marketing for the company, said Monday evening that Cinemagic policy prohibits backpacks and large bags from theaters. That policy still holds true, he said. The company has not determined whether Courtois did in fact attend the movie on Saturday or if he brought a bag with him, as he told police, according to Collins. The safety of our patrons is, and always has been, of paramount importance to Cinemagic, the company said in a statement after the Colorado shootings. As it has in the past, Cinemagic will continue to take all reasonable steps to provide a safe and wholesome environment for our valued moviegoers. A search of Courtois home at 344 Elm St. in Biddeford after his arrest uncovered more guns, including a machine gun, rifles, handguns and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Courtois made his initial court appearance in Springvale District Court on charges of having a concealed weapon and criminal speeding at 1 p.m. Monday by video from York County Jail, according to a court clerk. His bail is set at 50,000 cash or 150,000 real estate, with provisions that he not use or possess alcohol, drugs or dangerous weapons. He also must submit to random searches and testing under the bail conditions. Donovan said police checks haven t revealed any criminal history in Courtois background. State police received assistance from the FBI and ATF during the investigation. The York County district attorney s office and U.S. attorney s office in Portland will review the case to identify any other potential charges, according to McCausland. The Springvale District Court clerk said Courtois is scheduled to appear in York District Court at 8:30 a.m. Aug. 23. A man is accused of making criminal threats at a screening of the new Batman movie at a Southern California theater. The Los Angeles county sheriff's office said Monday that 52 year old Clark Tabor was being held on 50,000 bail. Deputies were called to the AMC Norwalk 20 cineplex around 5 p.m. Sunday after moviegoers complained of a man who started yelling when the showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" didn't start. Witnesses say Tabor then shouted, \"I should go off like in Colorado,\" and, \"Does anybody have a gun?\" A security guard saw Tabor with a backpack on his knees in the second row, and Tabor was arrested. Deputies searched the bag, the theater and its surrounding area but did not find any weapon.",

    "original_text": "CNN Pakistan cricketers have been told they will not be allowed to appear in the highly lucrative Indian Premier League IPL this coming season because of fears over security. Danish Kaneria, in action against India last December, was hoping to play in the Indian Premier League. Stars from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies and, for the first time, England will be competing in the action that starts on April 10. Several Pakistan stars had also signed for IPL franchises while another five, including leg spinner Danish Kaneria, were scheduled to appear at a players' auction to be held in Goa, India, on Thursday. However, the Pakistan Cricket Board PCB said players would not be allowed to play in the IPL this coming season on government advice. \"We have informed the IPL and Indian board that our players can't take part in the IPL this year,\" PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf told Reuters.com. The decision follows concerns for players' safety because of the tense relations between Pakistan and India after the Mumbai militant attacks in November. Former Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik, who plays for Delhi, said the players would abide by the directives of the government and PCB. Meanwhile, another former captain, Inzamam ul Haq is among several top Pakistan players who have successfully challenged a domestic ban imposed following appearances in the unofficial Indian Cricket League ICL . Provincial Sindh High Court on Monday suspended the 2007 action taken by the PCB which must appear in court later this month to explain their action. Players affected by the 2007 ruling also include Mohammad Yousuf, Imran Nazir, Mohammad Sami and Azhar Mahmood who along with Inzamam, played for Lahore Badshahs. Last year, the Badshahs named after a Pakistani city and with a number of Pakistani players won the ICL 20s Indian championship. \"The honorable court has suspended this relevant clause of the PCB rules and allowed the players to appear in domestic cricket with immediate effect,\" Zahid Fakhruddin Ibrahim, the legal counsel for the players, told Reuters.com. Lahore coach Moin Khan, a former Pakistan captain, said the suspension of the ban was good for Pakistani cricket. \"Some of the ICL players can still play for Pakistan and when they play in domestic cricket, youngsters will learn from them,\" Khan commented. \"The ban had hurt the players financially as well as cricket wise, so it's a great decision.\"",

    "original_text": "CLEVELAND An Ohio man whose hoax distress call triggered a massive U.S. Coast Guard search and rescue mission on Lake Erie must pay 489,000 in restitution, a U.S. appeals court said Tuesday. Danik Kumar, a licensed pilot, told authorities in March 2012 he saw what he thought was a distress flare coming up from a boat as he flew over Lake Erie near Cleveland. When asked by Cleveland Hopkins International Airport to take a closer look, Kumar did not see a vessel, but reported seeing more flares and a fishing boat with four people onboard wearing life jackets and active strobe lights, the opinion said. The 21 hour search included a 140 foot U.S. Coast Guard cutter, three smaller rescue boats, a rescue helicopter and a Canadian CC130 Hercules airplane. A month later, the then 19 year old freshman at Bowling Green State University admitted to making a false report. Kumar pleaded guilty to making a false distress call. A federal judge sentenced Kumar to serve three months in prison and pay restitution of 277,000 to the U.S. Coast Guard and 212,000 to the Canadian Armed Forces. His attorneys had argued that Kumar was liable only for the search's direct costs to the U.S. Coast Guard, estimated by a defense expert at 118,000, and no Canadian Armed Forces costs. A panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit upheld the federal judge's rulings. One judge dissented in part, finding she would have ordered the district court to reduce the \"inflated cost figure.\" Kumar has served his prison term, dropped out of school and may file another appeal, attorney Edmund Searby said Tuesday. \"Like every other litigant, the government should be limited to actual losses,\" Searby said. \"They are going to make him pay it off for decades.\" Reporting by Kim Palmer; Editing by David Bailey, Bernard Orr CINCINNATI AP An Ohio man who was 19 when he made a false distress call that triggered a massive, 21 hour search on Lake Erie must pay 489,000 in restitution to the U.S. and Canadian agencies involved in the needless rescue effort, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday. In a 2 1 ruling, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati found that a lower court properly ordered 21 year old Danik Kumar of Sandusky to pay for all costs associated with the March 2012 search, launched after he reported seeing a fishing boat with four people on board sending up flares on Lake Erie as he was flying a small plane overhead. About 70 personnel from the U.S. Coast Guard and the Canadian Coast Guard used three boats, a helicopter and a small plane before calling off the search. A month later, Kumar told investigators that though he originally thought he saw a single flare go up, he never saw a boat, according to court records. Kumar told investigators that he continued reporting a boat in distress for fear of sounding stupid and ruining his chances of becoming a Coast Guard aviator, court records say. After Kumar pleaded guilty to making a false distress call, federal Judge Sara Lioi sentenced him to three months in jail, and ordered him to pay 277,000 to the U.S. Coast Guard and 212,000 to the Canadian Coast Guard. In upholding Lioi's order, the 6th Circuit majority said that although the ruling is \"an onerous burden on the shoulders of a young man,\" U.S. law was intended to deal harshly with hoaxes to help deter future ones. In a dissenting opinion, Judge Helene White wrote that the government's estimated cost of the search was too high and shouldn't have included indirect costs, such as payroll processing and building maintenance. Kumar's Cleveland attorney, Edmund Searby, said he's considering his appeal options. \"It's just a sad story,\" he said. \"I'm not defending what he did, but it's an awful large penalty to pay. ... He's never going to recover on some level from this.\" The government's prosecutor, Michelle Baeppler, argued that Kumar needed to be held responsible for every cost associated with the search, from the gas used in the boats and aircraft to maintenance and depreciation costs incurred from their use. \"His claim that he should only have to pay for a few items ... is truly a simplistic and naive notion of the cost involved in conducting a search and rescue operation,\" Baeppler wrote. Searby never disputed that Kumar should pay restitution, but argued it shouldn't be any higher than 118,000. Searby said Kumar had to drop out of Bowling Green State University's aviation program and is figuring out what to do next. \"Danik's dream has long been to be a pilot, but it's unclear now whether that dream can be realized,\" Searby said. \"I'd hate for it to end like this.\" Follow Amanda Lee Myers on Twitter at https: twitter.com AmandaLeeAP",

    "original_text": "A family traveling to California found themselves stuck on an unplowed, snow covered road after following the fastest route on their GPS navigation system. Interested in Weather? Add Weather as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Weather news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest Ron Sanquist and Karen Bonell Sanquist, their 9 year old daughter and the family dog were en route from Oregon when they say their GPS system directed them straight through the Page Mountain Sno Park in the state s Rogue River Siskiyou National Forest. The family's car became stuck in the park, an area where many roads are not plowed at this time of year. The Sanquists had no shovel or cellphone service, with no help in sight. \"I am not even sure if I had a shovel what I could have dug out,\" Ron Sanquist told ABC News. The family took shelter inside the car overnight. The next morning, Ron Sanquist hiked 2 miles to find help and call 911. Karen Bonell Sanquist described the situation as \"pretty scary.\" \"Especially because to the left was a downgrade, quite a steep one,\" she said. Search and rescue crews reached the family and helped them get back on the road. The sheriff's office issued a warning for all drivers. \"Many GPS and map systems can steer folks in the wrong direction during winter travel where conditions are poor,\" the Josephine County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. The Sanquists were able to reach their final destination in California about 17 hours after their original departure. A similar situation happened to another couple in 2013 when their GPS directed them to a snowy stretch of highway that was closed because of treacherous conditions. The couple, Mark and Kristine Wathke, were driving from Yellowstone National Park to Miles City, Montana, when they became stuck for six days on Beartooth Highway in Cody, Wyoming. \"We never saw any road closed signs. We never saw any barricades,\" Kristine Wathke said in an earlier interview about their ordeal. The Wathkes said they survived on the food they had in their car, including bread, bottled water, a half empty jar of jelly and oatmeal packets. The couple was rescued by a rancher who took his snowmobile out to look for the Wathkes after the rancher's wife read on Facebook that the couple was missing. Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image ABC News screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk CNET Gadgets only know so much. The problem is that they act as if they know it all and humans are all too ready to believe them. I think, you know, humans rather like the thought of living in a gadget ruled authoritarian world. GPS is one of those gadgets to which we've become slaves. Sometimes, though, they send us up a certain creek without a paddle. Or a certain snowy mountain road without a cellphone service. As ABC News reports, the Sanquist family from Portland, Oregon mom, dad, 9 year old daughter and dog age unknown were on their way to California. Their GPS gave them the shortest route. This involved going up Happy Camp Road, near Page Mountain Sno Park, Oregon. But what the computer may not have considered is that this is December and, quite often, this is a month in which snow falls on mountains. Not every road gets plowed. So the Sanquists found themselves stuck. They didn't happen to have a shovel. Oh, and there was no cellphone service either. It's as if technology was ganging up on them. \"I'm not even sure if I had a shovel, I could have dug out,\" Ron Sanquist told ABC. So they bedded down in their car and thankfully had enough food in the hope that first light would bring hope. It was left to dad to trudge two miles in order to call 911 and get rescue experts to help them out. They arrived at their destination more than 17 hours late. This is neither the first nor last time that GPS has led people astray. It has led to death, just as it has led to cars and people submerged in 100 foot lakes. Gadgets aren't perfect. They're made by humans, who most certainly aren't perfect. Please beware. It's OK to go the long way around. In life, as in cars.",

    "original_text": "CNN A large storm system flooding portions of New York, Pennsylvania and New England on Friday afternoon has claimed at least eight lives, including seven in North Carolina, officials said. Nowhere was the misery more evident than Bertie County in northeastern North Carolina, where water in places was almost to the top of stop signs. The situation in the town of Windsor, which has about 2,000 residents, was dire Friday afternoon, said County Manager Zee Lamb. Perhaps 175 people have been rescued from rising floodwaters since Thursday night, Lamb said. \"A lot of people cannot get to their homes.\" Rescue shelters were set up and animals in a small zoo were taken to higher ground. Dramatic video footage showed the damage and the Cashie River, which is about 16 feet above flood stage. Most roads to the town were closed or partially closed. \"The county library is under 5 feet of water in the town of Windsor,\" Lamb said. \"You cannot get to the courthouse by road. I got here by boat today.\" Many businesses in the city are underwater, said Lamb, adding the county has asked the state for emergency assistance. Some buildings had water 6 to 7 feet deep on their first floor. Historic homes in the town were damaged. Townspeople were surprised by the extent of the flooding, Lamb said. \" Hurricane Floyd in 1999 was supposed to be the 100 year old flood. Eleven years later we have another major flood.\" The storm system was dropping heavy rain in the Northeast as the remnants of Tropical Storm Nicole interacted with an upper level low and a frontal boundary. An advisory from the National Weather Service said up to three more inches of rain may fall in the region. Flood watches and warnings were in effect from the mid Atlantic states to Maine. High wind warnings were in effect from Massachusetts to Maine, with wind gusts up to 60 mph. Boston was already feeling the effects, although the rain was expected to clear by Saturday morning. Philadelphia and much of eastern and central Pennsylvania were deluged by rainfall and a motorist died after driving into floodwaters near Skippack Creek, state troopers said. Troopers saw the vehicle floating near a golf course but were unable to reach the female driver, who was later found dead. Police said a 72 year old woman was trapped for more than eight hours inside her car in Cumru Township before she escaped, according to WFMZ. The outlook was for clearer skies later in the day. A weather related accident Thursday claimed four lives in Washington County, North Carolina, where a Jeep Grand Cherokee hydroplaned and ended up in a ditch filled with water. Four of five people in the SUV drowned. They were from Gwinnett County, Georgia. A 3 year old survived and was hospitalized Friday, officials said. Two motorists died in Dare County on Friday, and another was killed in Pamlico County, said Julia Jarema, spokeswoman for the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management. About 150 roads were in North Carolina at one point were closed and some people were evacuated in Bertie County, said Patty McQuillan, communications officer for the state's Department of Crime Control and Public Safety. Major road closures included U.S. 158 in Elizabeth City, U.S. 264 in Beaufort County and U.S. 17 in Windsor. In Swansboro, North Carolina, eight people were rescued, an emergency management official said. That scene repeated itself in a few other North Carolina and Virginia communities. Airport delays are expected to be crippling in the Northeast again, with ground stops and delays of three hours or more at the New York City airports and in Boston, Massachusetts. Baltimore, Maryland at 6.02 inches on Thursday had its wettest September day ever. Norfolk, Virginia, endured nearly 12 inches of rainfall. CNN affiliate WUSA showed images of flooding in St. Mary's County, Maryland. Rain left city streets underwater, stranded vehicles and sent scores of people to shelters and caused major delays at airports along the East Coast. Skies were beginning to clear Friday in much of the Carolinas and Virginia. Wilmington, North Carolina, has received 22.54 inches of rain since Sunday, the National Weather Service said. September's total of 22.72 inches was shy of the record 23.41 inches in 1999. \"Water wise, it was significant,\" said Warren Lee, emergency management director for New Hanover County, which includes three beach communities. Monday was actually worse than Thursday, said Lee, because the heavy rain hit bone dry ground and sparked flash flooding. Crews will do a damage assessment Friday, he said, indicating there were few evacuations and little wind damage. Sixty miles up the coast, there was extensive flooding in Swansboro, according to Norman Bryson with Onslow County Emergency Management. The town was completely cut off to vehicular traffic. In Carolina Beach, a lake overflowed and flooded downtown, a video from CNN affiliate WRAL showed one person kayaking through the streets. U.S. 421 remained closed Friday morning. Carolina Beach Town Manager Tim Owens said the weather was improving Friday and the town expects tourists to return for the weekend. He said some residents near the retention lake likely have some flood damage. \"We fared pretty well,\" he said. CNN iReporters snapped flood photos and told their tales. In upstate New York, Esopus Creek, a tributary of the Hudson River, overflowed and flooded shops and homes in downtown Phoenicia, said Kevin Keaveny. \"I've never seen the water come up to the streets,\" he said. Margaret Pelczynski of Buffalo, New York, was visiting Carolina Beach. \"This only confirms my beliefs that I'd gladly take a blizzard any day over this rain, wind and flooding,\" she wrote. And William Bernstein Jr. posted photos of Virginia Beach, Virginia. He said there were rescues Thursday and trees down in the Tidewater area. \"I believe this will be one we will remember a long time,\" he wrote. In Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia, many streets were flooded, as were stretches of Interstate 264, according to CNN Virginia affiliate WAVY 10. Some in the area are without power because of downed lines. Chris Hauser of Suffolk told WAVY he woke up to find water in his garage and up to 14 inches of water in his back yard, which is near a lake. As he stood on wooden planks just above the floodwater, Hauser quipped, \"Now I have my dock that I always thought about building.\" CNN's Shawn Nottingham, Angela Fritz, Dave Alsup, Phil Gast, Taylor Ward and Scott Thompson contributed to this report.",

    "original_text": "CNN It's a landmark that most players can only dream of, but for Lionel Messi it was just a matter of time. In a career already groaning under the weight of milestones, Messi duly passed another one on Saturday scoring his 400th goal for club and country as Barcelona smashed six unanswered goals past Granada at the Nou Camp. The landmark strike came in the 61st minute of the match heading in Dani Alves' volleyed cross to put Barca 4 0 up after a goal from Ivan Rakitic and two from Neymar had all but wrapped up three points before the break. Neymar completed his hat trick in the 66th minute before Messi tucked away his 401st career goal late on to complete the rout and seal Barca's biggest win in La Liga this season. Messi, still only 27 years old, has now scored 359 goals in competitive matches for Barcelona and 42 for Argentina. \"I never imagined I could achieve anything like this in my career,\" Messi said on his official Facebook page. \"Thanks for all the congratulations on scoring 400 goals with FC Barcelona and the Argentinian National Team. I'll continue working hard to reach more targets,\" he added. 'Magic wand' Barca manager Luis Enrique was quick to heap praise on his midfield maestro. \"I don't think if we added together the goals we have scored on the playground it would reach 400,\" Enrique said after the match. \"Messi is someone who has been touched by a magic wand and he is desperate to enjoy playing football.\" The four ton mark was passed by his La Liga rival Cristiano Ronaldo last January, but the Argentine has bragging rights after reaching the total in just 525 appearances compared to the Portuguese who took 653 games. As one landmark is reached another substantial record heaves into view as Messi looks to pass Telmo Zarra's all time La Liga goal scoring record of 251. Barcelona's win puts them top of the table with 16 points and a very healthy 17 goal difference a stat helped not only by recent high scoring wins but also by clean sheets in their opening six league games. Two points behind are last year's champions Atletico Madrid who also romped to victory on Saturday. Diego Simeone returned to the dugout following a touchline ban to see his team maintain their unbeaten start to the La Liga season with a 4 0 win against Sevilla. First half goals from Koke and Saul Niguez put Los Rojiblancos in control before two late second half goals sealed all three points a Raul Garcia spot kick made it three in the 82nd minute before Raul Jimenez made it four in the last minute of normal time. The win keeps lifts Atletico to second, one point ahead of Valencia who travel to Real Sociedad on Sunday. City rivals Real continued their recent run of form with a 2 0 win at Villarreal Luka Modric and Ronaldo on target for the visitors. Carlo Ancelotti's side are now level on 12 points with Celta Vigo who beat Elche 1 0 on Friday. Chelsea march on in EPL . Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Chelsea continue to dominate proceedings this term, picking up a fifth win in six matches with a 3 0 defeat of Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa's 32 million 52 million price tag is looking increasingly cheap as the Spanish striker netted for the eighth time since joining from Atletico Madrid in the summer. Costa's 59th minute strike gave Chelsea a two goal cushion after Oscar had opened the scoring in the seventh minute. Willian scored a third 11 minutes from time to ensure Jose Mourinho's side remain three points clear at the top of the table with 16 points. Former Chelsea man Frank Lampard was on target again for his new club as Manchester City beat Hull City 4 2. The win keeps Manuel Pellegrini's side five points adrift of the top. Manchester United also won on Saturday beating West Ham 2 1 at Old Trafford to move up to eighth in the table. Goals from Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie gave Louis van Gaal's side only their second league win of the season. Rooney was later shown a red card for a reckless tackle on Stewart Downing and will miss the next three league matches. The day's two big derby matches ended in 1 1 draws with Liverpool and Everton sharing the points at Anfield while Arsenal had to come from behind against Tottenham Hotspur at the Emirates.",

    "original_text": "Los Angeles CNN Lindsay Lohan, whose career has been derailed by drunken driving convictions, probation violations and a shoplifting charge, admitted in an interview with talk show host Jay Leno to \"poor decisions in the past\" but predicted an Oscar is in her future. Lohan, in a \"Tonight Show\" interview taped Monday and broadcast Tuesday, said she's \"willing to do the work that I have to do to follow through with being an actress.\" She hopes to be back on Leno's show in a few years with an Oscar, Lohan said. \"I've made a lot of mistakes and I've recognized that, but I'm in the clear now and I feel like as long as I stay focused then I will be able to, you know, achieve what I want to be able to achieve,\" Lohan told the NBC show's host. When Leno asked what one thing she would like to change about herself, Lohan said it would be the public perception of her. \"I want the public knowledge to be about my work, not about things that I didn't get into this business for, that I've put myself into positions where that was the bigger story than what I was working on,\" she said. Lohan, 24, said she's been cast to play mobster John \"Junior\" Gotti's wife in a movie, but a 120 day jail sentence and several months of community service for a probation violation threatens to keep her out of the movie. It starts shooting in October. Lohan's next stop: Skid Row . She is also scheduled to go on trial in June for allegedly stealing a gold and diamond necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. If convicted, Lohan could face up to a year in jail. The 13 days she spent in a Los Angeles jail last summer \"was an interesting experience and it was definitely a wake up call,\" Lohan said. \"And I think when it happened, everything happens for a reason. I don't know exactly what will happen.\" Her latest legal setback came Friday when Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner ruled that Lohan violated her probation on two 2007 drunken driving convictions by being arrested for the necklace theft. Lohan said she was \"kind of numb\" when Sautner sentenced her to 120 days in jail and 480 hours of community service. Lohan released from jail after posting bond . \"I was kind of shocked, I didn't really expect the outcome to be what it was, but I'm a big girl and I'm going to do what I'm told to do, continue on with working in my life and I'm taking responsibility,\" she said. The actress has admitted a drug addiction in the past, and she's spent at least eight months in substance abuse rehab in the last four years. She blamed her youth on her bad choices. \"Being young and being in a position that I was in, you don't really take the time to appreciate what you have, and it's all kind of a whirlwind and people make decisions for you,\" she said. \"But I'm not a kid anymore.\" Lohan's most optimistic statement came when Leno asked where she sees herself when she turns 30 six years from now. \"Hopefully, sitting here after winning an Oscar,\" Lohan said.",

However, women are now proving their worth in most walks of life. 'Saudi Women Revolution' makes a stand for equal rights . This month, Inside the Middle East focuses on a few women leading the charge: Iraqi political activists, Saudi artists, Turkish footballers and the renowned Egyptian author and feminist, Dr. Nawal Sadawi. We meet two Baghdadi women one a human rights activist and the other a blogger facing the challenges of trying to rebuild their shattered country and making sure the key decisions are not left solely to the men. Revolution signals new dawn for Egypt's women . Meanwhile in Istanbul, the base for this month's show, Turkey's first female film director Cahide Sonku adorns the wall of the Istanbul Modern Art Museum, which is celebrating Turkey's women artists.

    "original_text": "CNN A valuable necklace was stolen from a party at the Cannes Film Festival, the second major jewelry theft at the event this year, police said Thursday. Jeweler de Grisogono said the necklace, which was part of a collection making its debut, was worth 2 million euros 2.6 million . The company said it was the first theft in the company's 20 year history. Police in Nice, France, confirmed the heist but said the necklace was only worth 1 million euros 1.3 million U.S. . Police in Cap d'Antibes, the posh resort town where the party was held, gave a third figure 1 million 773,000 euros . The de Grisogono statement said it had hired more than 80 security guards for the event at the Cap Eden Roc hotel in Cap d'Antibes, just east of Cannes. On Friday, police in Nice said that more than 1 million in jewels belonging to the Swiss firm Chopard had been stolen from a hotel room in Cannes. Chopard later said in a statement that the value of the stolen pieces was \"far lower than those in the figures circulating in the media.\" The theft of the jewels occurred May 16, on the second day of the festival, which runs through May 26. Commandant Bernard Mascarelli of the Nice police said the jewelry was stolen from a room in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee who was staying in the room left it for several hours to go to dinner, he said. She returned to discover the whole safe containing the jewels had been unscrewed and taken away. No detailed description of the stolen jewels has been given, but a Chopard spokeswoman said they were not part of the firm's \"Red Carpet Collection 2013\" and were not due to be worn by any actresses in Cannes. There was no immediate indication the two thefts were connected. The annual festival brings together the rich and famous from around the world for movie screenings and glittering parties.

    "original_text": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 04:46 EST, 19 July 2011 . Nasa's Dawn spacecraft has home the first close up image of the massive asteroid Vesta after a four year, 1.7billion mile journey to get there. The robot surveyor is preparing to begin a study of a surface that may date to the earliest era of the solar system. Its entry into orbit on Saturday morning occurred while the spacecraft's antenna was pointed away from Earth, so mission controllers had to wait for Dawn to re establish contact to confirm its success. Craters visible: The Dawn spacecraft has sent back the first close up image of the massive asteroid Vesta after a four year, 1.7billion mile journey to get there . The capture was estimated to have occurred at at 6am GMT on Saturday, when Dawn was 9,900miles from Vesta and 117million miles from Earth in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, said Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Christopher Russell, from the University of California, Los Angeles and the mission's lead scientist, said: 'We are beginning the study of arguably the oldest extant primordial surface in the solar system.' Nasa said that after the orbital capture, Dawn sent an initial close up image taken for navigation purposes. Before the Dawn mission, images of Vesta were obtained by ground and space based telescopes but did not show much surface detail. Distant journey: An artist's impression of the ion drive propelled space probe Dawn arriving in the asteroid belt . Vesta is 330miles in diameter and is . the second most massive object in the asteroid belt. It is believed to . be the source of many meteorites that fall to Earth. Dawn . will continue to approach Vesta over the next three weeks, search for . possible moons and make more navigation images. It begins gathering . science data in August. Vesta's gravitational pull on Dawn will be measured to more accurately determine the asteroid's mass. The spacecraft will eventually get as close as 110miles from the surface. Smash and grab: The view of Vesta from Dawn a month ago, showing the asteroid's lop sided appearance. Scientists believe the planet lost its southern pole in a collision with a larger object which 'stole' the material . Long view: Vesta, from the Hubble Space Telescope, showing its distinctive shape . Dawn . was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in 2007 and used an ion . propulsion system to reach Vesta. Ion engines provide gentle yet . constant acceleration to achieve high speeds. The . spacecraft will study Vesta for a year and then continue on to the most . massive object in the main asteroid belt, the 'dwarf planet' Ceres. That encounter is due to occur in February 2015. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is managing the 291million mission for Nasa. UCLA . is responsible for the mission's science. The German Aerospace Centre, . the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, the Italian Space . Agency and the Italian National Astrophysical Institute also have roles . in the mission.",

A seaside shop is selling the unusually flavoured frozen dessert, using bits of real battered cod, deep fried potatoes and mushy peas. Tasty?: Nicole Plant samples Teare Wood Ice Cream Parlour's new fish and chip ice cream . New twist: The frozen desert, on sale in North Yorkshire, is served with a chip as a flake . Teare Wood's Ice Cream Parlour, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, has combined the traditional holiday tastes to tempt tourists. Shayne Wood, joint owner of the Pier Road venue, created the new range of chip shop inspired ice cream. Using fresh ingredients from Russell's takeaway next door, Shayne created Whitby's newest local delicacy. To complete the look, Shayne rolls the fish ice cream in batter and topped the whole lot off with a chip in the place of a flake. The guys at the chippy thought I was mad, Shayne said. But it was really easy. Unusual taste: The fish and chip ice cream is made using real fish and potatoes . Unusual taste: The fish and chip ice cream is made using real fish and potatoes . And it's actually quite nice kind of like a savoury fish cake but a bit more sweet. The three different flavours were made by breaking up the original ingredients and blending them with the usual ice cream mix, then whipping it up and freezing it. The task was made all the more difficult as last week one of the Jersey cows which supplies milk to the ice cream parlour was killed after being struck by lightning in a storm. It isn't the first time the parlour which has been open for four years has experimented with unusual flavours, having previously produced corned beef, coconut korma and roasted garlic flavoured ice cream. Garlic was horrible, really bad, said Shayne. But it turns out you can make pretty much anything into ice cream. There's no way we're going to serve this to the public though.",

    "original_text": "CNN A day before Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was busted by federal investigators on corruption charges, he dared authorities to tape his phone calls if they thought he was guilty of anything. Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, shown here in 2003, was known as a tireless campaigner. \"If anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it,\" Blagojevich said Monday outside a Chicago window factory where workers were protesting their layoffs. His comment came in response to a reporter's question about corruption allegations. Authorities had indeed bugged the governor's campaign office and tapped his home phone, catching him talking about alleged plans to sell the U.S. Senate seat left empty by President elect Barack Obama. During his political career, Blagojevich made headlines. A native Chicagoan, he was thought of as a charismatic guy who always liked to ingratiate himself to the working man. But he was never considered a natural politician, particularly when he first began exploring a run for the governorship in 2002. His father, Rade Blagojevich, was a Yugoslavian immigrant who came to America after World War II. The elder Blagojevich worked in a steel mill to support his family, which was then living on the city's then downtrodden northwest side. As a boy, Blagojevich held odd jobs shining shoes, delivering pizzas and worked in Alaska for two summers in his teens. He used the money to enroll in Northwestern University, a prestigious school in Evanston, Illinois, just outside of Chicago. He went on to law school at Pepperdine University, then went back to Chicago after graduation to be a lawyer. Blagojevich later joined the State's Attorney Office in Cook County the county in which Chicago is located and built a reputation for prosecuting domestic violence cases. During his time as a lawyer, where Blagojevich grew to enjoy the increasing public spotlight, he began flirting with the idea of running for office. He met his wife, Patricia Mell, in 1988 at a political fundraiser for her father, well known Chicago Alderman Richard Mell. Blagojevich started working in the father's office, married Patricia Mell and had a daughter, Amy. They had another daughter a few years later. He served in the Illinois House from 1992 to 1996, representing the North Side Chicago district before moving on to Congress in 1997. During his three terms in Congress, he helped bring 240 million in federal funds to the Chicago Transit Authority and an additional 10 million to help protect Lake Michigan's shoreline. He grabbed headlines in 1999 when he traveled to Yugoslavia with the Rev. Jesse Jackson to negotiate the release of three American soldiers. Blagojevich met with then President Slobodan Milosevic, who later faced a war crimes tribunal but died of a heart attack before the proceedings were concluded. Blagojevich set his sights on the governorship in 2002 with an aggressive appeal to the workaday Illinoisan. He portrayed himself as a regular guy who wanted to do right by the middle class. Tirelessly campaigning, knocking on doors and running down home flavored television ads, Blagojevich jokingly told voters not to worry about pronouncing his last name right. Just call me Rod, he said. At one point, a staunch supporter of his Republican opponent, Michael P. Flanagan, marveled to the Chicago Sun Times that he was impressed by the number of appearances Blagojevich was making during the campaign. \"He is one of the most energetic guys in politics today,\" Flanagan said in a Sun Times profile. \"If he was an athlete, they would test him for amphetamines. He would come up clean but they would test him.\" Blagojevich was able to leverage a string of endorsements from popular figures like Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. He also got the support of the Service Employees International Union, the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. In the 2002 governor's race, Blagojevich rode to victory 7 points ahead of opponent Jim Ryan. Blagojevich commenced his re election campaign in 2006 by promising not to raise state income or sales taxes during his second term. In May 2008, Blagojevich proposed a 150 million initiative to combat youth violence. In July, he pardoned 19 convicted criminals, including several who had been exonerated, and in August called a special legislative session to consider reducing state construction costs in order to increase money for schools. Earlier this week, Blagojevich was in the news again standing beside and supporting the workers suddenly laid off at the Chicago window factory. The employees complained that the layoffs came without the 60 days' notice required by federal law. Speaking to reporters as he stood with the workers, Blagojevich spoke of the need to follow the law. \"We are going to do everything possible here in Illinois to side with these workers,\" he said. \"And it isn't just lending them moral support, but it's ... making sure that we have our court system enforce the federal laws so these workers are getting what they're entitled to under the law and under what is the right thing to do.\"",

Senator Boonsong Kowawisarat was dining with Chanakarn Detkard and four others on Sunday when he took out an Uzi 9mm sub machine gun, police said. \"Senator Boonsong's gun was accidentally fired off while he was trying to keep his pistol into its case. The shot went straight into his secretary who was having dinner,\" Police Lt. Colonel Choosak Pulsawat told CNN. The police officer said that Boonsong had been separated from his wife for a while but they were currently living together. He added that Boonsong had permission to own such a weapon. Police have initially charged Boonsong with causing death by negligence but he cannot be arrested while the Thai parliament is in session unless the parliament rules otherwise. The Bangkok Post said the charge carries a maximum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a 20,000 baht fine US 640 . The newspaper said that Boonsong was so shocked by the shooting that he was unable to take Chanakarn to hospital. It is not clear why he was armed, why he took the weapon into the restaurant or whether he knew the gun was loaded. Boonsong is a senator from Mae Hong Song province, which borders Myanmar. The incident took place in Phrae province, also in northern Thailand. Gun ownership is common in rural Thailand but owners require a permit from the Ministry of the Interior.",

Ms Shaw said she saw damage to Ms Smith's front door, caused by her then partner Mr Collier, whom social workers had raised concerns about in the past. Derbyshire social services kept Ayeeshia on a safeguarding plan under the \"emotional abuse\" category. Ms Smith told Ms Shaw that Mr Collier had punched the front door, verbally abused her and kicked her in the stomach, the court heard. \"She got angry, swearing and stating to us to 'just take AJ away... because I am such a crap mother',\" Ms Shaw said. Ms Shaw said she always noted real \"emotional warmth\" between the mother and baby. \"She stated she loved Josh and he was going to be around long term and that she wanted to spend the rest of her life with him,\" said Ms Shaw. The health visitor explained to Ms Smith she \"may have to make a decision between Ayeeshia and Mr Collier\". After it emerged Ms Smith was still seeing Mr Collier, Ayeeshia was taken into foster care in June 2013. The court heard Ayeeshia was returned to Ms Smith in October that year and shortly afterwards social services became aware of her dating Mr Rigby. In January 2014, it emerged Ms Smith lied to Ms Shaw about the fact Mr Rigby had damaged the front door of her flat, by claiming they had been locked out. Ms Shaw noticed a cut on Ayeeshia's bottom lip, another under her chin and a newly appeared bald patch on her scalp and jurors heard this triggered a child protection medical review on 7 January. The family later moved to a flat in Burton upon Trent, where on 1 May Ayeeshia collapsed and later died. Post mortem tests identified a series of other current and historic injuries which the prosecution has said were deliberately inflicted. Ms Smith, of Sandfield Road, Nottingham, and Mr Rigby, of Sloan Drive, Nottingham, have also pleaded not guilty to allowing or causing a child's death and child cruelty. The trial continues.",

    "original_text": "Sneha Mashru, Anni's cousin, told Western Cape High Court she confided in her about her relationship. Shrien Dewani, 34, from Bristol, denies arranging the murder of his wife, who was shot dead in a hijacked taxi. The court was also told Anni went to a doctor before she left because she was planning to get pregnant. Ms Mashru told the court the couple had a lot of problems leading up to their wedding. \"That is why after the wedding, when they came back from India, Anni and I were talking about a divorce because she felt like she could not live with Shrien,\" she said. She said Anni had told her after the wedding she was not keen to spend time with Mr Dewani because they \"did not get on very well\". \"She went to have lunch with him and then she came back to the pool and said 'it felt very stiff between us'.\" Mr Dewani's lawyer Francois van Zyl told the court medical notes showed Anni visited her doctor just before the honeymoon and told him she was trying to conceive. In cross examining of Ms Mashru, Mr van Zyl said: \"I have to put it to you that what she told the doctor, that she wanted to become pregnant, that she wanted to get medication, flies in the face of what you told me about divorce.\" She replied that when Anni came back from her wedding in India, she told her she did not want to go on honeymoon. Zola Tongo, Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni have already been convicted of their role in Anni's murder. Mngeni died in custody last weekend. The prosecution argues that Mr Dewani was leading a secret double life and wanted out of his marriage, so arranged a staged hijacking in which he escaped and Anni was killed. On the first day of the trial he revealed that he is bisexual. It was also revealed in court that a male escort, Leo Leisser, claimed he had met with Mr Dewani and tried to sell his story to The Sun newspaper for 30,000. Before the court case, Mr Dewani denied ever having met Mr Leisser. The trial, which is expected to last at least until December, continues.",

    "original_text": "Lynn mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy, who claims over age Guatemalan immigrants are using schools . The mayor of a city in Massachusetts has claimed that some illegal immigrants who have entered from Guatemala and are enrolled in public schools have greying hair and more wrinkles than her. Judith Flanagan Kennedy, mayor of Lynn, said that many attending the schools are not children, but federal government will not allow officials to verify their ages. One of the students was revealed to be 35 years old, while others are clearly much older than 21 the oldest at which you are entitled to attend public schools in Massachusetts Ms Kennedy said. 'One of the things that we did notice when we were processing some of these students coming in was that they were adults,' she told CNS News at a press conference. 'There were people with greying temples,' she added. 'There were people with more wrinkles than I have around their eyes.' Most of the immigrants coming into the schools from Guatemala were claiming to be between 14 and 18 years old, but the schools have no way of officially verifying their real ages. Ms Kennedy says they have been told by the Department of Justice that they cannot, and with the number of Guatemalan students almost doubling from 2012 13 to the last academic year, she warned that this could lead to an increase in taxes, in order to pay for their education. In 2013 14, 101 Guatemalans enrolled at Lynn's public schools, compared with 56 the previous year. Public schools are required by law to enrol all children no matter their immigration status. A child, according to federal law, is someone for whom State education is provided and is within the age limits. In Massachusetts, that is between 3 and 21 years old. Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Lynn, Massachusetts, around 10 miles north of Boston . Ms Kennedy said that despite there being no official way to tell if these alien students are in fact adults, it can be very easy to tell. 'Every once in a while, we ll be able to determine that someone is well above the age at which they would be entitled to an education in the Lynn Public Schools,' she said. 'For example, if a student does not show up for a few days of classes, we will send our truant officers out to find out what s going on at that home.' She told of how officials turned up at the door of one 'boy' who had repeatedly been missing school, only to be told by a woman who answered that he was 35 years old. The Department of Justice stated to public schools back in May: 'You must ensure that you do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and that students are not barred from enrolling in public schools at the elementary and secondary level on the basis of their own citizenship or immigration status of that of their parents or guardians.' Lynn is around 10 miles north of Boston, and is the ninth biggest city in Massachusetts. The district is home to 26 schools.",

El Sisi's comment comes after a series of Egyptian airstrikes targeting ISIS in Libya in retaliation for the slaughter of 21 Egyptian Christians by the jihadist group. On Sunday, he said the Egyptian army isn't an aggressor angling to invade foreign territory. \"Your armed forces only protect the people of Egypt, and we coordinate with our Arab brothers,\" el Sisi said.

New Zealand faced an internet meltdown after people tried to view what they thought were new celebrity nude photos that had been leaked. The country's main internet provider Spark New Zealand, formerly Telecom crashed causing an uproar with their customers. Customers have been fuming that service has been down from Friday and it was only fully repaired on Sunday. Scroll down for video . caption . Spark believe that the first attack occurred after a handful of users clicked on links believing they would lead to new illicit images of celebrities but instead the link installed viruses that crippled the IP. The cyber attack comes after a user uploaded a list of many high profile stars in the nude. The photos included The Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, singer and actress Ariana Grande and Bristish model Cara Delevigne among many more. Jennifer Lawrence is one of the celebrities whose photographs have been leaked. She has come forward and claimed them to be real . Illicit photographs of Ariana Grande and Cara Delevingne were posted on image based site 4Chan . While some photographs were stolen from Apple's iCloud storage system but many celebrities have come out and denied the photos being real. From Friday night Spark took to Twitter and Facebook to inform their users that they were on the case. Spark tweeted that when people clicked on some links they inadvertently installed malware 'generating a high amount of traffic to overseas sites'. Trend Micro a computer security company issued alerts after the New Zealand cyber attack warning users not to open the links related to illicit photographs. Customers were not pleased that they were cut off from cyberspace for a whole weekend . 'For obvious reasons, clicking on links to 'naked celebrity' photos, or opening email attachments, would be a very bad idea right now. Expect criminals to ride this bandwagon immediately,' it said. 'Our scanning brought to our attention some freshly concocted schemes targeting those looking for the photos borne from the aforementioned leak. 'The first threat we found hails from Twitter, in the form of a tweet being posted with hashtags that contain the name of one of the leak's victims Jennifer Lawrence.' New Zealand authorities told ABC News they did not know who was behind the attack, which was launched from outside the country. From Friday to Sunday Spark Engineers worked to repair the damage caused by malware . Regular updates were made on the Spark Twitter page. Ironically they took to social media the place that the attack originated from . Internet service provider Spark took to Twitter to update their customers about the outage .",

    "original_text": "By . Karen Glaser . PUBLISHED: . 18:05 EST, 13 November 2013 . . UPDATED: . 18:05 EST, 13 November 2013 . Moved on: Karen Glaser has no regrets about splitting from her husband . The babysitter is booked, my little black dress has been dry cleaned and several pairs of killer heels lie scattered on the bedroom floor. Carefully applying oxblood red varnish to my nails, I struggle to recall when I last took so much time and trouble getting ready for a night out. But I have waited too long for this date to rush things and risk stepping out in the wrong outfit. Tonight, I want to look fabulous. Because tonight, I'm meeting my ex husband's new girlfriend for the first time. As I walk into the restaurant, my ex, Francesco, and his new lover are already there. As she smiles and offers her hand, I'm struck by how similar we look she is slightly fairer, but we are the same age and build. She's wearing a little black dress, too. I notice her looking at Francesco as I once did almost 20 years ago when we first met at an English language school in Italy. She is bubbly, attentive and excited to be with him. Francesco's physical renaissance is inescapable, too. The weight he'd gained in the last stale years of our marriage has melted away. He has new Prada glasses and is sporting sharp new threads. As I watch him unable to take his eyes off her, I try to pinpoint the emotion I'm feeling. Jealousy? Bitterness? Grief for the remnants of our 15 year marriage? Not a bit of it. In fact, all I feel is unmitigated joy. I could cartwheel across the room with happiness. I'm delighted that my former husband has finally found love again two and a half years after our divorce. Eighteen months ago I, too, fell head over heels with a new man. In fact, Steve accompanies me on this date to the restaurant and the four of us share a lovely evening. But rewind three years and the thought of actually wanting to spend time with Francesco was inconceivable. We first met in Sicily while I was teaching English, and Francesco who was a year older than me at 29 was one of my pupils: a sharp dresser with movie star sunglasses and a keen intellect. We fell for each other and moved to Britain in 1997, setting up home in North London. For the first few years we were very happy. Francesco was fun and we had a great social life. But like many long term relationships, our marriage had started straining at the seams once we'd had our much wanted and deeply loved children. Brawls about housework, childcare and bringing home enough bacon eroded the love we had once shared. Our arguments were all about the marital division of labour I felt I was doing the lion's share. In the end, our rows became so unpleasant, so frequent and so personal that I asked for a separation in November 2009. And the aftermath of our split was unusual in that when Francesco left the family home on May 1, 2010, he also left the country. He returned to his native Italy where, a couple of months before our separation, he had landed his dream job as a project manager for an architect. Young love: The writer and Francesco in the mid nineties . Finally, I was on my own, and it was such a relief not to have to nag him about the dirty socks under the bed and stubble in the sink. Far from feeling lonely, I felt wonderful waking up without him. But I was also left feeling terribly sad for my daughter and son, then nine and two. When I planned my family, this was not how I imagined the plot would turn out, and I felt guilty that Francesco and I had failed at our marriage. From the outset, we agreed that when Francesco visited the children every couple of months, he would stay with us. He no longer had a home in Britain and I didn't want their precious daddy time to be spent in anonymous B Bs and fast food outlets. It was emotionally important for our beloved children to see that the two people who had brought them into the world could actually be in the same room without biting each other's heads off. But I cannot pretend that I enjoyed Francesco's visits. They were a hard exercise in civility and restraint and having him back in my home reminded me of the mountain of irritations behind our failed marriage. 'I had moved on, which was wonderful for me, but cannot have been easy for Francesco, and I felt a scintilla of sympathy for him' Why couldn't he read a bedtime story without falling asleep before the children? Why did he spend so much time mouldering on the sofa? I'm sure Francesco had his own simmering irritations even if, for the children's sake, we were careful not to let them bubble over into actual rows. While married, he'd always accused me of nagging and that I didn't know how to relax. On the rare moments we found ourselves in a room without the children, it certainly felt awkward. That awkwardness became even more acute when, two years after our separation, I met Steve. Suddenly, a new and exciting chapter had opened in my life. I had moved on, which was wonderful for me, but cannot have been easy for Francesco, and I felt a scintilla of sympathy for him. It wasn't as if I could hide my new man on my ex's visits. Steve lives in the same North London mansion block as me a friend joked that I'd ended up with a 56 year old boy next door. A couple of months into our relationship, he was keen to be formally introduced to my former husband to 'be clear and straight about things'. But I held back. Even though I was confident Francesco was glad we had separated, the tensions between us were still palpable. Openly parading my new man would have felt like rubbing salt into a not quite healed wound. Francesco and I were friendly in a perfunctory sort of way, but we were definitely not friends. On good terms: Bruce Willis with his wife, Emma Hemming, left, is still friends with his first wife, Demi Moore, right, with whom he has children including daughter Tallulah Belle Willis, second from right . But then, one magic weekend six months ago, everything changed. It was one of Francesco's visits to see the children, and the minute he walked through the door I knew things were different. For what felt like the first time in years, he smiled at me properly and bent down and gave me a continental peck on the cheek. It was surprising and lovely in equal measure. He looked great. He'd slimmed down and was wearing smart new clothes. One word sprang to mind: girlfriend. Later that night, when the children were in bed, Francesco confirmed my happy suspicions. My ex had a new woman, an architect who also lived in Italy. He wasn't sure how long it would last, but he was very keen on her. 'I know,' I said. 'Your whole being is grinning.' And I really did know. It was a familiar grin. I'd undergone a similar renaissance in the early weeks of my relationship with Steve when I'd finally lost my baby weight, bought new lingerie the kind favoured by French politicians' mistresses and starting paying for aggressive depilation. I can genuinely say I felt nothing but delight for Francesco. These days, he and I grin a lot more at each other, too, and it feels so good. After years of sniping and nastiness, our children sense their parents' genuine friendship, their pleasure in each other's company. Split ends . The number of couples who divorce has been falling since reaching a peak of 165,000 in 1993 . But I am not deluding myself. My offspring would no doubt be cheerier still if their mother and father were happily married. Yet, given that we aren't, we are surely in a better place than we were. In a society where 42 per cent of marriages end, many of them with children in the equation, friendship between exes is surely the way forward. It is obviously far more pleasant for everyone if former spouses get on. What's strange is that I never really thought I could be one of those former spouses. I always wanted to be good friends with Francesco, but deep down I feared the conventional wisdom was probably right: you can't really be proper friends with someone who has seen you naked. Indeed, when my divorced friends told me they got on brilliantly with their exes and that all the rancour had gone, I was sceptical. But thinking about them now, I realise they all have one crucial thing in common: they all have new partners. They are on an equal footing. Like me and my ex he's happy, I'm happy. We can both start again. I now see that one of the biggest casualties of our relationship was respect. I had stopped admiring the man mouldering on the sofa, the snoring form in bed with whom I'd shared a marriage and a mortgage for more years than I wanted to remember, and had started taking him for granted. And I would say he had done exactly the same with me. Now when I see him smiling at his new lover, my only thought is: 'Good on you, my friend. I wish you every happiness in the world.'",

    "original_text": "Nearly 10 of school lessons are taught by supply teachers, according to education watchdog Estyn. Owen Hathway from NUT Cymru said there were concerns supply teachers are not being given the training they need. The Welsh government said it was developing ways for all teachers to \"develop their own practice\". Mr Hathway said supply teachers were concerned about training opportunities. \"We have to ensure that, at every lesson, those who are leading the classes are able to deliver it with the sort of standard quality that we'd expect,\" he said. \"And if we have a certain percentage of lessons taught by supply teachers who are not able to access the same level of professional development, then obviously consistency amongst that teaching standard is going to waver.\" The Welsh assembly's education committee is looking at supply teaching. Its survey of more than 900 pupils found nearly a quarter were taught by a supply teacher every week and 80 said they learned less with a supply teacher than with their usual teacher. Meilyr Rowlands, who becomes Wales' new chief inspector of schools next month, said it was unacceptable supply teachers were not given the support they need. \"The expectations on education and on teachers now are so high that we just can't afford to not give regular training for supply teachers, so something has to be done,\" he told AMs. One problem is that schools, supply teacher agencies and councils refuse to take responsibility for training, and supply teachers also miss out on important feedback from their work, he said. Cardiff supply teacher Mike Hyde said teachers could not afford to attend all the training days offered to them or they did not have the time. \"You're trying to pick up bits of the training that you need via other teaching staff that have undertaken the training. And, obviously then, it's quite often a watered down version and you end up with more questions you want to ask,\" he said. Teaching agency, E Qual, set up by former supply teacher Carolyn Rahman, offers free training days for supply teachers to keep them up to date with developments and maintain standards. But Ms Rahman said many other agencies did not provide this. \"I'd imagine it's cost, money, maybe time and effort,\" she said. \"We know our teachers and schools very well and we're a team that likes to share good practice. We like to know our teachers are comfortable and happy in their work.\" MY LIFE AS A SUPPLY TEACHER Supply teachers Catherine Davies and Yasmin Jones said they were sometimes not told until the last minute they were needed, with little time to prepare. \"If things are put in place for supply teachers, things can run a lot smoother,\" said Ms Davies. Ms Jones added: \"The job is a lot harder than people initially think.\" Mr Hathway said supply teachers themselves see a real deficiency and it can hit morale. \"Despite being excellent teachers in their own right, the longer they spend in supply, the lack of time they have for professional development is a real concern for them,\" he said. The Welsh government said head teachers needed to ensure supply teachers were properly qualified and registered. \"As we roll out the New Deal for the education workforce we will be developing ways for all teachers, including supply teachers, to reflect upon and develop their own practice,\" said a spokesman.",

    "original_text": "But Plaid Cymru AM Sian Gwenllian warned the Welsh Government should be \"advocating membership of the single market\" not just access. Caroline Jones said UKIP would fight for \"as low a tariff as possible\". While the Tories' Nick Ramsey said he wanted to be in the single market. Mr Skates was speaking on BBC Wales' Sunday Supplement programme about the Labour AMs vote on Wednesday against a Plaid Cymru assembly motion to support \"full membership\" of the single market. But he said it was \"nonsense\" they had sided with UKIP and the Conservatives on the issue. Mr Skates said: \"I think Plaid Cymru are somewhat confused in terms of what membership and access actually mean. I think they believe it comes without an obligation to have free movement of people. \"If they think you can pick and choose in terms of membership what you then have to comply with, they need to state very clearly they're in support of no change to immigration.\" He said: \"What First Minister Carwyn Jones and I and the Welsh Government have been crystal clear on is that we need free and unfettered access to the single market. \"In reality, what that means in a simple sense is you don't have tariffs. \"Even countries like Norway, the EEA countries like Iceland and Liechtenstein and so forth, don't describe themselves as members of the single market because being a member of the single market means you essentially have to be a member of the EU. \"What Prime Minister Theresa May has said... is there will be a bespoke rather than an 'off the shelf' deal which means the EEA option for the UK is something she's not seriously considering... It's there to be negotiated. \"In the absence of any other indication from the UK Government... we are saying we are filling that void at the moment with a compelling argument for ensuring that Britain retains unfettered access to the single market while also recognising that in the referendum immigration was a major issue so we cannot maintain free movement of people.\" Ms Gwenllian told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme: \"It seems to me they Labour have reached a hard Brexit position in line with what the Tories and UKIP are saying. \"It seems to me Plaid Cymru is the only party now united around what we think is the best deal for Wales.\" Caroline Jones AM said: \"We want to be with everyone in Europe. I think there will be a tariff on access but we will fight for as low a tariff as possible.\" Mr Ramsey AM said: \"Personally I would rather we were in the single market, whatever form that takes. \"We need some form of access to that market and I think we're all singing from the same hymn sheet on that.\"",

    "original_text": "CNN Arsenal have confirmed that striker Robin van Persie will be out of action for \"approximately six weeks\" after suffering ankle ligament damage during the Netherlands' international friendly against Italy on Saturday. Initially it had been feared the Dutch forward who has scored eight goals in 15 games in all competitions this season and emerged as one of the Gunners' key figures could be set for a much longer spell on the sidelines. Van Persie, 26, will return to London later this week to continue his rehabilitation but is set to miss key clashes with Premier League leaders Chelsea at the end of the month, the trip to Liverpool on December 13 as well as the rest of the hectic Christmas schedule. An official Arsenal club statement read: \"Following the care given to van Persie by the Dutch FA, he will travel back to London this week and continue his treatment with the Arsenal medical team. \"Van Persie will be out of action for approximately six weeks.\" Although van Persie could be back for what is likely to be a season defining few weeks when Arsenal host Manchester United on January 31 before games against Chelsea and then Liverpool, the loss of the player could not have come at a worse time for Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. Denmark striker Nicklas Bendtner groin and England forward Theo Walcott knee are already out until early December, so Croatian international Eduardo da Silva is likely to take van Persie's place in the Gunners side. Van Persie suffered the injury to his right leg in the 10th minute of Saturday's goalless draw against Italy in Pescara. He was carried off on a stretcher following a heavy challenge from Azzurri defender Giorgio Chiellini and tests showed partially torn ligaments in his right ankle. Meanwhile, France defender Eric Abidal will miss the second leg of the World Cup playoff against the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday night due to a thigh injury. The Barcelona full back played the full 90 minutes of Saturday's 1 0 win in Dublin but sustained the problem in his left leg and will not be available for the return at the Stade de France. Lyon midfielder Jeremy Toulalan has also been ruled out, as he has not yet recovered from a hamstring injury.",

    "original_text": "Around 2.5m viewers watched last year's series, which showcased wildlife at the site, the largest reed bed in the North West. Autumn is a good time to spot a wide range of species at the Silverdale reserve, near Morecambe Bay. Male stags clash in their breeding season, known as the rut, at this time of year. A female hind is only fertile for a few days each year so competition for a mate is fierce. Deers' behaviour can change during the rut and it is recommended that people and dogs don't go near the testosterone fuelled stags, who can be aggressive. Dawn and dusk are the best times to see these majestic creatures the largest residents at Leighton Moss lock horns. Another autumn highlight is the dance of starlings at sunset. New camera technology will provide insights into why the birds flock in this mesmerising way, known as mumurations. Annabel Rushton from RSPB Leighton Moss says: \"Starlings are present in Britain all year round. \"However, during the autumn, we get migrant starlings over from Europe which causes a swell in numbers and leads to the murmurations at this time of year in particular.\" Leighton Moss is also one of the best places in the UK to see bearded tits. However the birds' name is considered misleading because they sport more of a Hulk Hogan moustache than a beard. Their call has also been compared to a musical sneeze. The species' population has declined due to a loss of reed bed habitats worldwide. Ms Rushton says conservation efforts to create and protect reed beds means \"bearded tits are doing much better in the UK\". But after a mild winter and relatively decent summer, she says 25 adult pairs and 61 young \"a healthy population\" are nesting at the reserve. Otters are also at Leighton Moss all year round, playing in the water and catching eels. \"They can be seen best in the early mornings and at dusk. During summer and autumn, the mother has her young out with her in the day making them easier to spot,\" says Ms Rushton. On the edge of Morecambe Bay, where mudflats and salt marsh provide food for several birds, RSPB Leighton Moss is ideal for many species. \"Morecambe Bay is the size of Manchester and is a canteen for 250,000 birds each year, feeding on the rich variety of creatures that live in the mud,\" says Ms Rushton. Autumnwatch starts on BBC Two on Tuesday 28th October at 20:00 GMT",

    "original_text": "Iain Vigurs pulled a simple chance wide of the Dundee goal in the first half. Home goalkeeper Scott Bain saved a Ross Draper drive but was helpless when David Raven rounded off an Inverness break after an hour of play. Inverness keeper Owain Fon Williams saved a Greg Stewart penalty before Hemmings struck and Inverness forward Andrea Mbuyi Mutombo was sent off. The visitors have struggled to find the net this season, with only three goals prior to kick off, and Mutombo passed up a glorious chance to increase their tally. Inverness captain David Raven swung in a cross from the right but the Belgium born midfielder headed the ball wide of the target from just eight yards. Vigurs played a wonderful one two with Raven but with the goal gaping the 27 year old blasted the ball wide of goal. The home side had plenty of possession with Hemmings and Stewart looking lively but they lacked a cutting edge in front of goal. Caley took the lead through Raven when the home defence stood off and allowed him time to curl the ball into the corner beyond Scott Bain. Nicky Low had a chance to equalise when he intercepted a Carl Tremarco pass back but was forced wide by Fon Williams. With seven minutes left the home side were awarded a penalty when Danny Devine handled a cross into the box. Stewart stepped up but his left foot shot was brilliantly saved by the visiting keeper. Paul Hartley's side kept pushing forward and, after Paul McGowan missed a glorious chance at the back post, Hemmings slid the ball home. The drama, though, was not over and referee Andrew Dallas sent off Mutombo for a challenge on Nick Ross. Match ends, Dundee 1, Inverness CT 1. Second Half ends, Dundee 1, Inverness CT 1.

    "original_text": "PALM BEACH, Fla. Reuters President Donald Trump s deputy national security adviser, K.T. McFarland, is expected to step down and has been offered the position of U.S. ambassador to Singapore, a U.S. official said on Sunday. Kathleen Troia \"K.T.\" McFarland arrives at Trump Tower in New York, U.S., January 3, 2017. REUTERS Mike Segar The move will be seen as a victory for Trump s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, who is retooling the national security team he inherited from retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who resigned as Trump s first national security adviser in February. McFarland, 65, is a former national security analyst for Fox News and was one of Trump s original hires after he won the presidential election on Nov. 8. The exact date of her departure was unclear, said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. News of her pending departure came less than a week after Trump removed his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, from the National Security Council at McMaster s urging. Bannon had a seat on the council s principals committee, which included the secretaries of state, defense and other ranking aides. Flynn was forced to resign on Feb. 13 over his contacts with Russia s ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, before Trump took office on Jan. 20. McFarland s expected departure will likely elevate the status of Dina Powell, who is deputy national security adviser for strategy. She had served in Republican President George W. Bush s State Department, and had advised Trump s daughter, Ivanka Trump, during Trump s transition to the presidency. Trump s White House has been rife with infighting and palace intrigue as the president has struggled to get past some early stumbles. K. T. McFarland has been asked to step down as deputy National Security Advisor to President Donald Trump after less than three months and is expected to be nominated as ambassador to Singapore, according to a person familiar with White House personnel moves. The departure of the 65 year old former Fox News commentator comes as Trump s second National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, puts his own stamp on the National Security Council after taking over in February from retired General Michael Flynn. McFarland proved not to be a good fit at the NSC, the person said, adding that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was involved in the decision as well. Her removal follows a reorganization of the NSC in the past week that removed Stephen Bannon, Trump s chief strategist and senior counselor, from the principals committee, the Cabinet level interagency forum that advises the president on pressing security matters. Other officials, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were brought back onto the committee as regular attendees, reversing a move made in January. The changes were outlined in a presidential memorandum dated April 4. Former Goldman Sachs executive Dina Powell stays on as another deputy national security adviser, and a second person is expected to be named to a similar role to replace McFarland. Personnel Changes Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Trump s young White House has been marked by several personnel changes, including the reassignment of Katie Walsh, its first deputy chief of staff, and reported infighting between the camps of Bannon on the one hand and adviser Trump son in law Jared Kushner on the other. In that clash, the pair were asked to iron out their differences, which have played out in the media, and concentrate on backing the president s agenda. McMaster looked to minimize the significance of the demotion of Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart News, which came as the president was weighing options for action against Syria, his administration s first major decision on a military intervention. This is not as significant as it appears, said the 54 year old Army lieutenant general. Steve Bannon provides the president with advice on a broad range of issues and will continue to do so. Kathleen Troia K.T. McFarland was brought to the White House by Flynn, who was fired for not disclosing his level of contacts with Russia to the president or vice president. A staff member of the NSC in the 1970s, McFarland lost a bid for the 2006 Republican Party U.S. Senate nomination in New York. The most recent U.S. ambassador to Singapore, Florida attorney and Barack Obama fundraiser Kirk Wagar, departed in January upon Trump s inauguration. McFarland s appointment would be subject to Senate confirmation.",

The Lions have played in Lewisham since 1910 and at The Den since 1993. \"I can't rule out relocation in the event the CPO went through,\" Kavanagh told BBC Radio 5 live. Lewisham Council aims to regenerate the land around Millwall's ground in conjunction with property developer Renewal as part of the 'New Bermondsey' scheme, which proposes to create 2,400 homes, community facilities and a new overground station near the stadium. Kavanagh says Millwall \"actively\" support regeneration of the area, but the League One club want to be involved in any scheme as the current CPO would affect the future of their academy and the Millwall Community Trust MCT . \"We are calling for regeneration and development but we don't want to feel we are not important in this,\" Kavanagh added. \"If we are treated in such a manner that this CPO goes through and we are not at the heart of the proposed redevelopment, then we have to consider what we do. \"I have to look at every single angle to make sure the commercial viability and the long term future of the club, and its community trust, is well served where we live.\" Lions supporters have been vocal in their opposition to the CPO, with an online petition against the proposals gathering more than 27,000 signatures. Tim Farron MP has been among the politicians to speak out about the plans, with the leader of the Liberal Democrats saying it would be \"heartbreaking\" for Millwall fans and the local community if the club were forced to move. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan also \"wholeheartedly supports\" Millwall remaining in Lewisham. On Monday, Kavanagh wrote to the council seeking talks about the \"critical issues\" surrounding the CPO, which the council said were a factor in the postponement of Wednesday's meeting. \"There has been an ongoing exchange of correspondence between the council and Millwall FC over the last few weeks,\" a statement from Lewisham Council said. \"A little more time is needed to complete this, and so the mayor and cabinet is not in a position to reconsider the decision. \"We are asking Millwall to provide outstanding information by 23 January as we intend to reconsider and make the decision in February.\" The council has previously stated it is \"very supportive\" of Millwall and that its ability to operate at The Den \"must and will be protected\".",

    "original_text": "On Saturday, two days before the scheduled start of the Geneva talks, Syria's foreign minister ruled out any discussion of presidential elections. US Secretary of State John Kerry responded by accusing Damascus of \"trying to disrupt the process\". He was speaking after meeting European foreign ministers in Paris. France accused Syria of \"provocation\". A cessation of hostilities agreed by most participants in the conflict began late last month. It excludes so called Islamic State IS and al Qaeda's branch in Syria. The purpose of the partial and temporary truce was to enable the warring sides and their foreign backers to launch a fresh attempt to end the five year conflict. The story of the conflict What is a cessation of hostilities? How Putin is succeeding in Syria But the latest diplomatic row began when Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said on Saturday that any talk of a new presidential election was off the agenda. \"This is an exclusive right of the Syrian people,'' he said. The main Syrian opposition umbrella group, the High Negotiations Committee HNC , said the pre conditions could halt the talks before they had even started. On Sunday Mr Kerry met his counterparts from France, the UK, Germany, Italy and the European Union in Paris. Afterwards he said Mr Muallem was \"clearly trying to disrupt the process\", adding that Syria's allies, Russia and Iran, had made clear \"there must be a political transition and that we must have a presidential election at some time\". French Foreign Minister Jean Marc Ayrault said Syria's \"provocations\" were a \"bad sign and did not reflect the spirit of the ceasefire\". On Sunday the HNC said it would push for an interim government in which President Bashar al Assad and the current leadership would have no role. The indirect talks in Geneva are mediated by the United Nations. UN special envoy to Syria Staffan de Mistura has said he wants presidential elections to be held in the next 18 months. The fate of President Assad has been one of the main stumbling blocks in previous talks. The last round collapsed in February without agreement. More than 250,000 Syrians have been killed and about 11 million people have been forced from their homes in five years of Syria's civil war, which began with an uprising against Mr Assad. Government forces, supported by Russian air strikes, have made gains against rebel fighters in recent months.",

Clearly it was a glitch, but presenter Cory McCloskey refused to get hot and bothered about it, calmly telling his viewers to get out while you can . The map showed wildly inaccurate temperatures for several areas of the state, including 2960 farenheit for Cave Creek. Scroll down for video . Climate change appeared to be out of control in Arizona according to a Fox 10 News weather map this week . McCloskey exclaimed, as the news reporters laughed in the background, that 'steel boils at around that temperature, doesn't it?' He added: 'There's probably nothing left up there. So don't even bother looting. It's not going to be worth it. He continued: Wow, 750 degrees in Gila Bend right now. And 1270 in Awatukee. I'm not authorised to evacuate Ahwatukee but this temperature seems pretty high. Frankly, Wickenburg is a total loss. You might as well get out. Surprise is starting to heat up as well. The safe spots seem to be Chandler and Mesa. But you're surrounded by some pretty intense heat. I'm not your dad, but I would get out. While you still can.' Weatherman Cory McCloskey was praised for making light of the map temperature errors . A clip of the report was uploaded to YouTube and his coolness under pressure won him many admirers. Archlorddestin10 said: Good job. Took the error and made it entertaining so people wouldn't get angry. Maria Clark, meanwhile, wrote thought he played it off well and Antuan Rzenesepa described him as a true professional'. The hilarious computer error follows a Fox News gaffe of a human nature. Last November news host Megyn Kelly managed to slip up while introducing Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. Kelly managed to pronounce his name correctly the first time around, but when it came to reading out the title of his show named after himself she blurted out 'F abee' instead. As she made the gaffe, former Republican presidential candidate Mr Huckabee appeared to crack a smile before Mrs Kelly corrected herself.",

    "original_text": "By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 09:14 EST, 14 October 2012 . . UPDATED: . 15:32 EST, 11 November 2012 . Under pressure: BBC Director General George Entwistle admitted he knew nothing about the corporation broadcasting child sex abuse allegations before they went out . BBC insiders have called the Director General's claim that he didn't ask about the content of the canned Jimmy Savile Newsnight documentary 'barely credible' and 'ridiculous'. At a press conference on Friday, George Entwistle, who expressed his 'revulsion' at the thought of Savile's abuse at the BBC, claimed he never asked questions about the nature of the Newsnight investigation dropped last year, saying he wanted to ensure the independence of news and current affairs. At the time Mr Entwistle was Director of the Vision division, which is responsible for commissioning, producing, scheduling and broadcasting the content of all of the BBC's television channels. The Independent reported that media commentator Steve Hewlett, who presents Radio 4's The Media Show, yesterday called the claim 'simply implausible', adding: 'The idea that he didn't know is barely credible.' David Elstein, the former chief executive of Channel 5, added his voice to the condemnation, saying Entwhistle would have to be 'pretty brain dead' not to investigate the programme's subject matter. Mr Entwistle, who also apologised to victims on behalf of the BBC, told reporters that Helen Boaden head of news had told him that Newsnight was planning a programme about Savile. He said that he said 'thanks for letting me know', but asked no questions about it. A senior BBC newsroom source told the Independent: 'It defies credibility that he didn't try to find this out. 'The idea that, as head of vision, in charge of the Christmas schedule, he just said 'thanks for letting me know' is ridiculous. 'The best thing you can say is he looks completely incurious to the point of being irresponsible. He looks hopeless.' Tension: A source says BBC director general's comments have split the Newsnight newsroom . The source added that Newsnight journalists are 'extremely tense' and feel like they were left 'looking stupid' by Mr Entwhistle's comments. 'You have a huge national story that was not mentioned on Newsnight until 10 or 11 days after it blew up. The newsroom is getting uncomfortable. It is very tense. It is a ludicrous situation,' they added. The source also spoke about the claim of Peter Rippon, the editor who dropped the Savile investigation, that the story was not good enough to air. They added: 'He did everything he could to make it impossible for the story to run... In most newsrooms if you are not quite there with a story you would just keep going.' The paper added that it understands the Newsnight team had spoken to at least 10 women, including witnesses and victims. A BBC spokesperson said: 'George Entwistle has made his position exceptionally clear. As said at the press briefing on Friday, 'I was the Director of Vision for the television department at the BBC, I had no influence or authority over investigations carried out by BBC News and it's very important that I always behaved in a manner which absolutely bore out that lack of authority or responsibility'.' Sorry: Entwistle also apologised to victims on behalf of the BBC and says he feels 'revulsion' that the attacks may have taken place at the BBC . Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.",

    "original_text": "CNN The unexpected resignation of David Petraeus as head of the CIA must have come as a shock to many Americans, especially given his impeccable record as a distinguished military commander. But like the greatest heroes from Shakespeare, it would appear that he was not exempt from the time honored temptations of human folly and self destruction. And now the plot is thickening, as details emerge that Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, is involved somehow in the scandal. As Americans are coming to terms with the revelation of Petraeus' adultery, on the other side of the Atlantic, the feeling among the French can be summed up by a blas shrug. Every time a steamy sexual intrigue is laid bare near the corridors of Washington power, the French don't see what all the fuss is about. It's only sex, after all. It's impossible to imagine a French political leader resigning because of an extramarital indiscretion. If this rule were observed, the French parliament would be nearly vacant. The Petraeus affair: A lot more than sex . The past five French presidents are known to have had at least one and in some cases, many more mistresses throughout their political career. The current resident of the Elys e Palace, Francois Hollande, has been caught in the middle of an embarrassing dispute between his previous and current female companions. The French, long used to regarding their leaders with cynical detachment, have been following this tormented domestic feud with interest and maybe some contempt. The details of Petraeus' sexual dalliance with his own biographer, Paula Broadwell, are unquestionably fascinating. Still, the French like to consider themselves blithely indifferent to bedroom antics, even when those involved are married to other people. Opinion: How Petraeus courted the press . Le Monde, the intellectually self important leftist newspaper, noted that the Petraeus affair quickly jumped from the pages of the respectable New York Times to those of the gossipy tabloid New York Post. In other words, while the Petraeus scandal may indeed be a legitimate affair of state because of the sensitivity of his position at the summit of the CIA, what really interests Americans are the juicy details of the four star Army general's sexual conquest. French bafflement at American prurience has a history from Bill Clinton's anteroom encounters with White House intern Monica Lewinsky to the more recent misadventures of Eliot Spitzer and Anthony Weiner. All have ended with abject confessions. The French usually attribute this American ritual of guilt and contrition to \"puritanism.\" This is meant as a put down and a mark of French cultural superiority. The French, by contrast, are mature and sophisticated, never shocked and titillated by the rich complexity of life's temptations. France is a Catholic society devoid of the puritanical guilt that is deeply embedded in the Anglo American psyche. The French draw a line between private and public vice, whereas in America and Britain, the distinction is blurred if not merged entirely. In France, a politician can betray his wife without being suspected of screwing voters. Moreover, French journalists are not driven by the same \"fourth estate\" ethos that animates American media culture. French society in general has an ambiguous relationship with the truth, and French journalists are frequently indifferent to the exposure of hard facts. When the subject is the sexual indiscretion of politicians in high office, media indifference can be counted on because press and political circles in Paris are often intimated linked professionally, socially and sexually. Hence the famous media \"omerta\" about the private lives of French politicians. This convenient arrangement reached a high point of hypocritical disregard for the truth during the presidency of Francois Mitterrand, when the French media kept the secret of his double life including an illegitimate daughter living in an official residence at taxpayers' expense for nearly two decades. Everyone knew about it, nobody wrote about it. Opinion: How Petraeus changed the U.S. military . The shocking conduct of Dominique Strauss Kahn shattered this longstanding media omerta. But French journalists are still reluctant to probe too aggressively into the private lives of politicians. They have good reason. In France, there are strict laws that make privacy invasion illegal and punishable. Only last month, Strauss Kahn, though disgraced and banished from French politics, sued a magazine for publishing a photo of him and his new girlfriend. And he won damages in court. As the eye popping details of Petraeus' complex personal life emerge in the American media, don't expect the French to respond with disbelief. They will claim they don't really want to know. No wonder. When it happens in France, they are often never told. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Matthew Fraser.",

    "original_text": "The furor underscored the continuing troubles for the White House since Mr. Trump first accused Mr. Obama of tapping his phones, an allegation refuted by intelligence agencies as well as Republican and Democratic officials. Even as Mr. Trump refused to back down, fellow Republicans appeared increasingly irritated by what they see as a distraction from their policy goals. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said on Friday that Mr. Trump had not proved his case and should apologize to Mr. Obama. Frankly, unless you can produce some pretty compelling truth, I think President Obama is owed an apology, Mr. Cole told reporters. If he didn t do it, we shouldn t be reckless in accusations that he did. The conspiracy theorizing also tested what is often called the special relationship between the United States and Britain. American intelligence agencies enjoy a closer collaboration with their British counterparts than any other in the world. GCHQ was the first agency to warn the United States government that Russia was hacking Democratic Party emails during the presidential campaign. Foreign policy analysts expressed astonishment that Mr. Trump would so cavalierly endanger that partnership. It illustrates the extent to which the White House really doesn t care what damage they do to crucial relationships in order to avoid admitting their dishonesty, said Kori Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush now at Stanford University s Hoover Institution. America s allies are having to protect themselves against being tarred with the White House s mendacity. Eric S. Edelman, an under secretary of defense under Mr. Bush, has written about the stresses between the United States and Britain in recent years. I hope that this latest episode doesn t drive a stake through the heart of the strongest remaining element of Anglo American partnership, he said. Julianne Smith, who was a deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Mr. Trump did not appear to realize how much American intelligence agencies depend on Britain in dealing with threats around the world. He will probably live to see the day when he will regret firing off such an egregious insult to Britain and then failing to apologize for it, she said. The issue clearly touched a nerve at GCHQ, which usually refuses to comment on intelligence matters. Its vehement response surprised British officials and analysts. Dominic Grieve, the intelligence committee chairman in Parliament, pointed to elaborate safeguards that prevent spying on the United States and require a valid national security purpose for any monitoring. It is inconceivable that those legal requirements could be met in the circumstances described, he said. Washington CNN White House press secretary Sean Spicer flatly denied Friday that the White House apologized to the British government after citing an uncorroborated Fox News report to allege that a UK intelligence agency spied on President Donald Trump at the behest of former President Barack Obama. Earlier in the day, however, a senior administration official told CNN that Spicer and national security adviser H.R. McMaster offered what amounted to an apology to the British government for Spicer's comments on Thursday, when he cited a Fox News report that said British intelligence helped wiretap Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign. \"I don't think we regret anything,\" Spicer told reporters at a gaggle Friday afternoon. Asked by CNN's Jim Acosta if there was an apology by the administration to the British government over the matter, Spicer replied, \"No, we were just passing on news reports.\" Earlier Friday, a White House official told CNN that McMaster spoke with his British counterpart on Thursday about Spicer's comment. The official described the conversation as \"cordial\" where McMaster described Spicer's comment as \"unintentional.\" McMaster also told his counterpart that \"their concerns were understood and heard and it would be relayed to the White House.\" The official said there were \"at least two calls\" from British officials on Thursday and that the British ambassador to the United States called Spicer to discuss the comment. \"Sean was pointing to the breadth of reporting, not endorsing any specific story,\" the official said. White House officials later told CNN that it was British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch and Sir Mark Lyall Grant, national security adviser to Prime Minister Theresa May, who \"expressed their concerns to Sean Spicer and Gen. McMaster\" in two separate conversations on Thursday. \"Mr. Spicer and Gen. McMaster explained that Mr. Spicer was simply pointing to public reports, not endorsing any specific story,\" one official said. Spicer spoke to Darroch face to face at a White House St. Patrick's Day event, according to a British government official, who described the meeting as \"serious\" in tone and said it was not cordial. 'These claims are ridiculous' Earlier Friday, a spokesman for May said senior UK officials had protested to the Trump administration after the claims were repeated by Spicer. \"We've made clear to the US administration that these claims are ridiculous and should be ignored. We've received assurances that these allegations won't be repeated,\" May's spokesman said. JUST WATCHED Trump doubles down on wiretapping claims Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump doubles down on wiretapping claims 01:19 At a Thursday press briefing, Spicer read out allegations originally made on Tuesday on Fox News by legal analyst Andrew Napolitano, that the UK intelligence agency GCHQ the equivalent of the US National Security Agency had spied on Trump. \"Judge Andrew Napolitano made the following statement, quote, 'Three intelligence sources have informed Fox News that President Obama went outside the chain of command to spy on Trump . He didn't use the NSA, he didn't use the CIA ... he used GCHQ,'\" Spicer told journalists. The strong language from Downing Street which followed a similar, rare statement from the UK intelligence agency GCHQ indicated that the British government was furious that the US had made such an incendiary allegation. GCHQ: Wiretap claims are 'nonsense' Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ in Cheltenham, England. GCHQ said the claim was \"nonsense\" and should be ignored. The agency rarely comments on specific operations, and almost never in such blunt terms. Asked if the conversations between the US and British officials were heated, the British government official pointed to the rarity of a GCHQ public statement on the matter, saying, \"you can draw your conclusions from there.\" Then, at a regular press briefing, Downing Street said it had sought and received reassurances that the allegations would not be repeated. What is GCHQ? The UK government's eavesdropping agency, it carries out electronic surveillance to combat terrorism, cyber threats and serious crime. It's one of three UK intelligence agencies, the others being MI5, the domestic security service, and MI6, the foreign intelligence service. GCHQ's collaboration with the United States dates back to the Second World War. Its operations are shrouded in secrecy and it rarely makes public statements. It has its headquarters in the English spa town of Cheltenham and says it employs more than 6,000 people. \"This shows the administration doesn't give the allegations any credence,\" the Downing Street spokesman said. \"We have a close special relationship with the White House and that allows us to raise concerns as and when they arise, as was true in this case,\" he added. Britain is particularly sensitive to any suggestion that the US would use GCHQ to keep \"American fingerprints\" off the spying. UK intelligence agencies work closely with their US counterparts, as well as those in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as part of the \"Five Eyes\" intelligence sharing agreement. May's spokesman argued this pact precluded the kind of spying alleged by Napolitano, saying: \"I would add as a matter of fact that under the 'Five Eyes' intelligence agreement, we cannot use each other's capabilities to circumvent the law. It's a situation that simply wouldn't arise.\" Concern over claims Susan Rice, national security adviser in the Obama administration, said Spicer's claims put the intelligence sharing relationship between the US and UK at risk.\"The cost of falsely blaming our closest ally for something this consequential cannot be overstated,\" she wrote on Twitter. Tim Farron, leader of the UK Liberal Democrat party the junior coalition partner in the last British government described the White House claim as \"shameful\" and said it risked harming US and UK security. \"Trump is compromising the vital UK US security relationship to try to cover his own embarrassment,\" he tweeted. The Senate Intelligence Committee had said on Thursday it had found no evidence Trump Tower had been under surveillance in 2016, contrary to Trump's previous claims. \"Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016,\" committee chair Richard Burr said. JUST WATCHED Ryan: I've seen no evidence wiretap occured Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ryan: I've seen no evidence wiretap occured 04:54 The same day, House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN in an interview that he also hadn't seen any evidence of a wiretap or a surveillance order against Trump Tower. On Friday, Rep. Tom Cole, R Oklahoma, told CNN's Manu Raju that Obama is owed an apology for Trump's \"reckless\" comment on wiretapping. And Rep. Charlie Dent, R Pennsylvania, warned that Trump's comments and the White House's decision to dig in on the claims are undercutting the President's credibility and sapping his political capital at a time when he's trying to push a budget and health care overhaul through Congress. Trump originally made the allegations against Obama on March 4 in a series of early morning tweets. \"Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my 'wires tapped' in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\" he said on his official Twitter account. Just under two weeks later, in an interview with Fox News' Tucker Carlson, Trump appeared to walk back his original wiretapping allegations \"Wiretap covers a lot of different things,\" Trump told Carlson on Wednesday. \"I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks.\" WASHINGTON Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump stood by unproven claims on Friday that the Obama administration tapped his phones during the 2016 White House race and shrugged off a dispute with Britain over the notion their spy agency had a hand in it. British Prime Minister Theresa May s spokesman earlier in the day dismissed the charge against Britain s GCHQ spy agency as ridiculous and said the White House had promised not to repeat it. But at a news conference Trump brushed aside a question about whether it was a mistake to accuse British intelligence of eavesdropping. We said nothing. All we did was quote a certain very talented legal mind who was the one responsible for saying that on television. I didn t make an opinion on it, Trump said. He was referring to Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano who on Tuesday accused Britain s Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ intelligence agency of having helped Obama, a Democrat, wiretap Trump, a Republican. White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Thursday quoted Napolitano s comments about GCHQ during a testy briefing with reporters. But speaking at the White House news conference, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at his side, Trump distanced himself. That was a statement made by a very talented lawyer on Fox, and so you shouldn t be talking to me, you should be talking to Fox. OK? Trump said while standing by his initial charge that the previous U.S. administration eavesdropped on him. As far as wiretapping, I guess by this past administration, at least we have something in common, perhaps, he said to Merkel. U.S. ties with Germany were frayed by news reports in 2013 citing leaked intelligence documents that Washington had bugged Merkel s mobile phone.

REUTERS Kieran Doherty File Photo NO APOLOGY A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said British officials had voiced concern to senior Trump aides but the official declined to explicitly apologize for Spicer s citation of the Fox News allegations. The Republican Trump, president since Jan. 20, tweeted this month that his Democratic predecessor had wiretapped him during the late stages of the 2016 campaign. Trump offered no evidence, and an Obama spokesman has said the claim is simply false . Leaders of both major parties in Congress have joined a growing chorus disputing it. On Friday, the U.S. Justice Department said it had responded to a request by committees in Congress for documents that could shed light on Trump s claim. A government source, who requested anonymity when discussing sensitive information, said an initial examination indicated it contained no evidence to support Trump s charge. On the Fox Friends program, Napolitano, a political commentator and former New Jersey judge, said that rather than ordering U.S. agencies to spy on Trump, Obama had obtained transcripts of Trump s conversations from GCHQ so there were no American fingerprints on it. Late on Friday, Fox News anchor Shepard Smith said: Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano s commentary. Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way, full stop. Dominic Grieve, chairman of the British Parliament s Intelligence and Security Committee, said a U.S. president cannot task the GCHQ to intercept an individual s communications. In a rare public statement, the GCHQ, Britain s equivalent of the U.S. National Security Agency which monitors overseas electronic communications, said the claims should be ignored.

    "original_text": "By . Ryan Lipman . The Australian Commonwealth Games women's swim team uniform is a shock for all the wrong reasons part of the country has been left off. After the team's formal uniform was slammed as being 'ugly' when it was first revealed last month, the latest problem is the state of Tasmania has been completely left off maps of Australia that are pasted on the women's swim team's one piece swimsuit. The missing state has caused outrage in Tasmania, with many in the state still sensitive about a similar blunder 32 years ago, which saw the island state dropped from a map of Australia created by performers at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982. Uproar: Tasmanians have been left outraged that a map of Australia heavily featured on female swimmers' uniforms does not include the island state. Pictured is swimmer Leiston Pickett, left, getting help with her uniform from teammate Kotuku Ngawati during a training session . Australian swimmers Kotuku Ngawati left , and Bronte Campbell right , show off their swimming uniform during a training session on Tuesday . The Speedo design has even sparked the ire of outspoken Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie, reported News.com.au. 'I hope that it was an oversight and not deliberate. Tasmania also disappeared from Olympic medals and posters for Baz Luhrmann s movie Australia, so it's very disappointing that the same oversight has happened a number of times, she said. The senator has even suggested the state be compensated with 5 million for a tourism advertising campaign and money to lower the cost of sea travel to Tasmania. With funding cuts to Tasmanian tourism since 2008, Ms Lambie said an apology with a payment from the government would not be enough to rectify the error, especially for the impacted tourism sector. Tasmanians have hit out at the uniform, after the state was dropped from a map of Australia formed by performers at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in a similar incident 32 years ago. Pictured is swimmer Cate Campbell helping sister Bronte adjust her swimsuit . While the women's uniform is plastered with the partial map of Australia, the male swimmers' trunks are not covered in the controversial pattern. Pictured is Emily Seebohm, left, and James Magnussen, far right, with Cameron McEvoy . 'Ordinary Tasmanians will be offended and feelings will be hurt. We're very proud of our state, however more than just feelings will be hurt,' she said. During the games, seven Tasmanian athletes are representing their state. In another shocker, Tie Me Kanagroo Down was not what Australian athletes expected to hear while heading to the flag bearer's ceremony in Glasgow. There are reports a Scottish bus driver played the song by paedophile musician Rolf Harris' as he drove the Aussie athletes on Monday, reported News.com.au. The track was stopped shortly after it started and was featured on an Aussie hits CD bought by the driver and was the third song after Land Down Under and I'd Love to Have a Beer With Duncan. Cyclist Anna Meares was unveiled as Australia's flag bearer during the ceremony. Anna Meares was announced as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, during the Australian Commonwealth Games official team reception on Monday . Another blunder for the Commonwealth Games was that two unidentified Australian athletes set to compete at the games could have missed their chance at taking gold after a blunder saw them entered in the wrong event. The unaware pair have not been told of the error because it 'has nothing to do with the athletes' said Australian Commonwealth Games Association Chief ACGA executive Perry Crosswhite, who is refusing to confirm the athletes' identity or sport. 'One athlete was entered in the wrong event and the other was not entered for an additional event they should have been in,' he said. He also said it was possible the athletes involved do not know the were caught up in the oversight. The mix up saw 48 athletes from eight countries granted special dispensation by the Commonwealth Games Federation CGF so they can take part in their events, reported News.com.au. Entry deadline was June 11 and a CFG statement stated the athletes' administrators were behind the bungle which meant the athletes were not entered could have resulted in them not competing in their events. 'It was never an issue. They were always going to be in. We just had to go through a process that didn t come out until yesterday,' Crosswhite said. 'Absolutely there was a mistake. The ACGA made an entering mistake and we admitted it straight away and we made sure it was corrected.'",

I sent her the picture and she called me back saying it's her father. She's on her way to the hospital now. The daughter later called Mr Ortiz to confirm it was indeed her father, he wrote on the Facebook page. My joy comes from the fact that his family was able to connect with him, Mr Ortiz later wrote, All I did was pay a little more attention to my environment. Multiple family members posted messages of thanks to both Mr Ortiz and the station. One comment likely echoed the thoughts of many of Frayo s family and friends.

More than 70 workers were in the 11 storey building which was under construction when it toppled in heavy rain late on Saturday. India has seen frequent building collapses, many blamed on lax safety and substandard materials. At least six people, including construction company officials, have been arrested in connection with the collapse in Chennai Madras , the capital of the southern state of Tamil Nadu. \"It appears they have not adhered to approved plans. The building appears to have serious structural defects,\" Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa said. Hundreds of rescue workers, including personnel from India's National Disaster Response Force, are working with cutters, shovels and other equipment to search for survivors. \"Clearing the debris is a huge challenge. This would take almost two to three days and we are hopeful of saving many lives, going by our previous experiences in other places,\" senior police official SP Selvan told the NDTV news channel. While the cause of the latest collapse is still under investigation, a lack of construction codes, leading to lax safety, is one reason for frequent collapses of buildings and other infrastructure projects in India. There is also a high demand for housing, pushing up costs and forcing less affluent people to risk their lives in decrepit or badly constructed buildings. Earlier on Saturday, a four storey building came down in the capital Delhi, killing 10 people, including five children. In January, at least 14 people died when a building under construction came crashing down in the western state of Goa. At least 42 people died after a four storey building collapsed in Mumbai last September.",

    "original_text": "CNN World number one Rafael Nadal says 2010 has been a dream year so far, after the Spaniard recovered from a knee injury in 2009 to reclaim his French Open and Wimbledon crowns, and the world number one ranking. \"It's just amazing for me you know, more than dream because I was 11 months without winning a tournament, so that wasn't an easy time for me,\" he told CNN's Open Court. The 24 year old said he was so happy with his success as he was not sure if he would ever return to the top of tennis after his knee problems forced him out of the sport last year. After being knocked out in the fourth round of the 2009 French Open by Sweden's Robin Soderling, preventing him from winning a fifth consecutive title in Paris, Nadal's ongoing knee problem also stopped him from competing and defending his title at Wimbledon. Home hopes distant ahead of U.S. Open . \"It was a hard month after that retirement from Wimbledon. It was probably one of the hardest months of my career,\" he said. \"I worked very hard to build my level but I have doubts and at moments I didn't know if I'm going to be another time at my best.\" Nadal's injury worries also coincided with problems off the court, as he struggled to come to terms with his parents' divorce. However, he refuses to blame any of his losses on his family situation. \"It wasn't an easy moment for me, but it happened very often these moments for everybody so just accept that and accept the change. \"I always suffer for my mum, for my dad, for my sisters, so that makes me think more than things on tennis but it's not for that reason I lost the matches.\" In fact, Nadal, who is coached by his uncle Toni and still lives on his home island of Majorca surrounded by relatives, credits his close knit family for his happiness and for keeping him grounded. \"The family is very important. They make me feel good always because if I won, when I started to be famous the relationship never changed with my friends and family,\" the eight time grand slam champion said. \"I am very lucky because when I come back home I have a completely normal life. I can relax, playing golf, fishing doing what I want. I know when I finish a tournament, I am going to relax at home.\" But even though he is happiest at home with his family, Nadal admits that he copes with the attention he receives being the world's best tennis player much better now than he did at the start of his career. \"I was shy when I was a kid, I was very shy, but now I think I've improved a lot. \"I can speak ok with the media and with the people. My English is still bad but I feel a little bit better now than before.\"",

    "original_text": "By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 12:11 EST, 4 February 2013 . . UPDATED: . 19:51 EST, 4 February 2013 . The new Archbishop of Canterbury warned David Cameron yesterday that there will be no retreat by the Church of England in its opposition to same sex marriages. Within minutes of his formal confirmation into the post, the Right Reverend Justin Welby reaffirmed his stand on the new laws to open up marriage to gay and lesbian people. We have made our views clear and I m very much with the House of Bishops on this, said Dr Welby, backing the Synod body which contains the Church s bishops. He added: The Government wants it. We think there are issues around the way it is going forward. The 105th Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby insisted he remained opposed to the government's plans for gay marriage as he took up his post in a ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral . Dr Welby s message denies the Prime Minister any possibility of a compromise with the Church of England in advance of voting by MPs on the legislation today. It came only three days after the CofE bluntly told MPs it does not trust the promises of the Government that churches will be shielded from the impact of gay marriage law. The Archbishop tried to reassure Mr Cameron that he is not looking to open up his stewardship of the Church of England by picking a fight with the Government. It is not a collision course. It s just part of the normal discussion that one has, Dr Welby said. I have no idea how the vote will go, so I am not going to get into hypothetical questions. I stand, as I have always stood over the last few months, with the statement I made at the announcement of my appointment, which is that I support the Church of England s position on this. Mr Welby said he had not changed his view on the same sex wedding plan since being appointed in November . Hundreds of people packed into St Paul's today, for a blessing given by Mr Welby at the close of the ceremony to confirm his election as Archbishop to replace Rowan Williams . We have made many statements about this and I stick with that. The Church made its final verdict on the laws clear at the weekend in a briefing paper drawn up for MPs, encouraging them to vote against the legislation. It said Church leaders do not trust the Government s promises that churches will be immune from legal retribution if they fail to conduct same sex weddings. MPs were told: We retain serious doubts about whether the proffered legal protection for churches and faiths from discrimination claims would prove durable. Too much emphasis, we believe, is being placed on the personal assurances of ministers. The Most Reverend Justin Welby gives his blessing at the close of the ceremony to confirm his election as Archbishop of Canterbury at St Paul's Cathedral . The Church has said protections written into the law would be vulnerable to challenges. The Government claims a quadruple lock will ensure churches are not forced to conduct gay marriages, but the CofE has warned a European court ruling could find against the safeguard. The paper warned about uncertain and unforeseen consequences for wider society and the common good when marriage is redefined in gender neutral terms . The Church complained that the reshaping and unnecessary politicising of a fundamental social institution was not advertised in election manifestos, did not appear in the Queen s Speech, and has no mandate from the electorate. Dr Welby, 57, spoke after a confirmation service at St Paul s Cathedral marked the formal beginning of his job as Archbishop. The final step in the process will be his enthronement at Canterbury Cathedral next month. The father of five said he looked forward to his new role but also felt challenged and awed by it. It is an enormous privilege and my experience is to trust in the grace of God, not in your own abilities. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Mr Justin Welby, and his wife Caroline on the steps of St Paul's after the ceremony .",

While most of the 3.5 million people who visit Sydney's iconic inner city gardens are primarily interested in the array of exotic flora and it's panoramic harbour views, an alarming amount of green thumbs are knocking off plants. Now, workers at the Royal Botanic Gardens fear the extinction of some rare species, as thieves are walking out with plants hidden in their backpacks or sports bags. An exotic plant caged in Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens. Unfortunately the Royal Botanic Gardens would not provide the name of the plant, for fear it's rarity could be targeted for garden thieves . Dr Brett Summerell, deputy executive director at the Royal Botanic Gardens explained to Daily Mail Australia his concern if plant robberies continue to occur. 'It is quite problematic,' he said. 'I don't think people understand that in the Botanic Gardens there are plants collected for scientific purposes, which tell us a lot of detail about the species and where they are from. 'It is very difficult to recollect some of these plant species and it is becoming more and more difficult to display them, especially if we are losing them we won't want to put the important ones out.' In an attempt to conserve the existing plants, extra security has been set up throughout the garden to monitor any unusual activity among the visitors. Small plants have been locked in zoo like cages, while surveillance cameras and park rangers troll the grounds for plant thieves . While most of the 3.5 million people who visit Sydney's iconic inner city gardens are primarily interested in the array of exotic flora and it's panoramic harbour views, an alarming amount of green thumbs are knocking off plants . Small plants have been locked in zoo like cages, while surveillance cameras and park rangers troll the grounds for plant thieves. 'It is just one of those things where we have to put cages around the smaller ones until they are big enough which make it harder for people to steal them,' Dr Summerell said. Each year, the Royal Botanic Gardens lose around five exotic plants from theft, leaving them at a loss of thousands of dollars. 'The plants have a significant value approximately several hundreds to a thousands dollars some of them aren't even on the market. 'But it isn't the commercial value that is important, it is the cost of travelling to a region that is difficult to get to it could cost thousands to actually get the plant. 'When you think of travelling to Cambodia for a specific species, well that isn't cheap.' High on the list for thieves are cacti, orchards, cycas and general palms which are easy to pull out . High on the list for thieves are cacti, orchards, cycas and general palms which are easy to pull out. Dr Summerell said usually garden staff tend to be understanding when confronting robbers. 'One of the horticulturists saw someone pulling out some plants we had to have hard words with them and it turned out they just wanted to bring a bit of the plant home they didn t think it would impact the plant,' he said. 'In cases where people are stealing whole plants with criminal intent they are typically handed over to police'. Dr Summerell described the plant thieves as garden enthusiasts who are looking to compliment their homes with exotic plants. 'A lot of them are keen to have it in their garden collection but in other cases, which are more concerning, it is because the plants are rare and endangered and almost impossible to get get.' Although it is 'difficult to sell plants on the black market', Dr Summerell believes a few of the stolen plants are sold illegally. Dr Summerell said the phenomenon of stealing plants have been going on for years, however, thanks to technology it is now easier to monitor. 'This has been an ongoing problem... it is something you have to be concerned about and take into account whenever you are planting.' Sydney's Royal Botanical Gardens urge anyone who witness visitors stealing plants to report it to staff.

Nearly 300 trucks carrying supplies to U.S. led troops in Afghanistan clogged the Pakistani border crossings Sunday, leaving them vulnerable to militant attack a day after Islamabad closed the frontier in retaliation for coalition airstrikes that allegedly killed 24 Pakistani troops. As Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani attended the funerals of the victims, including a major, the U.S. sought to minimize the fallout from the crisis, which plunged Washington's already troubled relationship with Islamabad to an all time low. Pakistan also ordered the U.S. to vacate an airbase that is used by American drones to target al Qaida and Taliban militants in the country's tribal region along the Afghan border. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stuck: Cargo trucks, including those carrying supplies to NATO forces in Afghanistan, are halted along the Pakistan border, after it was shut down . No passage: A Pakistani security personnel stands guard beside trucks carrying supplies for NATO forces in Afghanistan that are parked at the Pakistan's border crossing . Heavily guarded: On Sunday, Pakistani soldiers buried 24 troops killed in a NATO cross border air raid Saturday . There are forces working against a . total rupture in the relationship. Pakistan still relies on billions of . dollars in American military and civilian aid, and the U.S. needs . Islamabad's help to push Afghan insurgents to engage in peace talks. But tensions could rise further if militants unleash attacks against the stranded trucks ferrying NATO supplies to Afghanistan. The attack is the worst single incident of its kind since Pakistan uneasily allied itself with Washington in the days immediately following the September 11 attacks on U.S. targets. A spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force ISAF said he believed aircraft that had been called in to provide air support for ground troops was responsible for the Pakistani casualties, guardian.co.uk reports. NATO has called the attack a 'tragic unintended incident.' Laid to rest: Pakistan army soldiers carry coffins of Saturday's NATO attack victims in Peshawar, Pakistan . Salute: Pakistan army soldiers march among the rows of coffins . Suspected militants destroyed around 150 trucks and injured drivers and police a year ago after Pakistan closed one of its Afghan border crossings to NATO supplies for about ten days in retaliation for a U.S. helicopter attack that accidentally killed two Pakistani soldiers. The situation could be more dire this time because Pakistan, outraged at the alleged NATO attack before dawn Saturday, has closed both its crossings. Nearly 300 trucks carrying coalition supplies are now backed up at Torkham in the northwest Khyber tribal area and Chaman in southwestern Baluchistan province. Last year, Pakistan only closed Torkham. A Pakistani military statement immediately denied those claims, saying they were attacked first and had to respond 'with all available weapons.' Pakistani officials say the troops at the outposts were sleeping at the time of the attacks. John Allen, the US commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, issued a statement saying the incident had his 'highest personal attention.' Burning: Pakistani protesters burn a US flag in response to against the NATO strike on Pakistan troops . Protest: Pakistani demonstrators shout slogans against America and NATO in Lahore, Pakistan on Saturday as tensions between the two nations increased . He said: 'My most sincere and personal . heartfelt condolences go out to the families and loved ones of any . members of Pakistan security forces who may have been killed or injured.' The White House said on Saturday that senior US civilian and military officials have extended condolences to their Pakistani counterparts following the deaths, with the Obama administration pledged a full investigation into the attack. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta in a joint statement offered their 'deepest condolences' and said they 'support fully NATO's intention to investigate immediately.' Keeping watch: Pakistani security officials stand guard near trucks carrying logistics supplies destined for NATO's forces in Afghanistan Saturday night . Hold it: Pakistani security personnel stop trucks carrying supplies for NATO forces in neighboring Afghanistan at the Takhtabeg check post in Khyber, Pakistan . Lining up: Nearly 300 trucks line up in the outskirts of Quetta after the Chaman border crossing was closed . US Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter also met with Pakistani government officials in Islamabad. The statement said: 'In their contacts, these US diplomatic and military leaders each stressed in addition to their sympathies and a commitment to review the circumstances of the incident the importance of the US Pakistani partnership, which serves the mutual interests of our people. 'All these leaders pledged to remain in close contact with their Pakistani counterparts going forward as we work through this challenging time,' the statement concluded. Full probe: The President and Hillary Rodham Clinton support 'NATO's intention to investigate immediately' The unidentified officials also said they wanted to work with Pakistan to investigate the deaths, the Associated Press reports. The airstrike dealt a huge blow to American efforts to rebuild its strained relationship with Pakistan. The White House statement did not address Pakistan's decision to block supply routes for the war in Afghanistan or its demand that the US to vacate the base. Supply trucks were stopped on their way into the country at the Takhtabeg check post in the tribal area of Khyber, Pakistan. Talks: Pakistani senior cabinet members, including Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, left, met today in Islamabad today to discuss all arrangements with NATO and the U.S. The two countries have found tensions . rising since the killing of Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden by US . special forces in a secret raid on the Pakistani garrison town of . Abbottabad in May. Pakistan called the raid, which took place in the early hours of Saturday morning, a flagrant violation of its sovereignty while the Foreign Office equally condemned the attack. 'Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has condemned in the strongest terms the NATO ISAF attack on the Pakistani post,' ministry spokeswoman Tehmina Janjua said in a statement. 'On his direction, the matter is being taken up by the foreign ministry in the strongest terms with NATO and the US' Nato helicopter attack . The commander of NATO led forces in Afghanistan, General John R. Allen, said he had offered his condolences to the family of any Pakistani soldiers who 'may have been killed or injured' during an 'incident' on the border. A spokesman for the force declined further comment on the nature of the 'incident' and said an investigation was proceeding. It was not yet clear, he said, whether there had been deaths or injuries. Two military officials said that up to 28 troops had been killed and 11 wounded in the attack on the Salala checkpoint, about 2.5 km 1.5 miles from the Afghan border. The attack took place around 2 a.m. 2100 GMT in the Baizai area of Mohmand, where Pakistani troops are fighting Taliban militants. Pakistani soldiers on patrol today close to the area near the Afghan border where a Nato helicopter killed up to 28 troops . A senior Pakistani military officer said . efforts were under way to bring the bodies of the slain soldiers to . Ghalanai, the headquarters of Mohmand tribal region. 'The latest attack by NATO forces on our post will have serious repercussions as they without any reasons attacked on our post and killed soldiers asleep,' he said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media. About 40 Pakistani army troops were stationed at the outpost, military sources said. Two officers were reported among the dead. NATO supply trucks and fuel tankers bound for Afghanistan were stopped at Jamrud town in the Khyber tribal region near the city of Peshawar hours after the raid, officials said. Attack: Nato helicopters similar to this one opened fire on the checkpoint close to the border with Afghanistan killing 28 people, it was claimed . 'We have halted the supplies and some 40 tankers and trucks have been returned from the check post in Jamrud,' Mutahir Zeb, a senior government official, told Reuters. Another official said the supplies had been stopped for security reasons. 'There is possibility of attacks on NATO supplies passing through the volatile Khyber tribal region, therefore we sent them back towards Peshawar to remain safe,' he said. The border crossing at Chaman in Baluchistan was also closed, Frontier Corps officials said. Pakistan is a vital land route for 49 percent of NATO's supplies to its troops in Afghanistan, a NATO spokesman said. Reflecting the confusion of war in an ill defined border area, an Afghan border police official, Edrees Momand, said joint Afghan NATO troops near the outpost Saturday morning had detained several militants. 'I am not aware of the casualties on the other side of the border but those we have detained aren't Afghan Taliban,' he said, implying they were Pakistani Taliban operating in Afghanistan. The Afghanistan Pakistan border is often poorly marked, and differs between maps by up to five miles in some places. The incident occurred a day after U.S. General John Allen met Pakistani Army Chief of Army Staff General Ashfaq Pervez Kayani to discuss border control and enhanced cooperation. A similar incident on Sept 30, 2009, which killed two Pakistani troops, led to the closure of one of NATO's supply routes through Pakistan for 10 days. Angry: Pakistan's Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani has condemned the attack . NATO apologised for that incident, which it said happened when NATO gunships mistook warning shots by the Pakistani forces for a militant attack. The attack is expected to further worsen U.S. Pakistan relations, already at one of their lowest points in history, following a tumultuous year that saw the bin Laden raid, the jailing of a CIA contractor, and U.S. accusations that Pakistan backed a militant attack on the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. The United States has long suspected Pakistan of continuing to secretly support Taliban militant groups in a bid to secure influence in Afghanistan after most NATO troops leave in 2014. Saturday's incident will give Pakistan the argument that NATO is now attacking it directly. 'I think we should go to the United Nations Security Council against this,' said retired Brigadier Mahmood Shah, former chief of security in the tribal areas. 'So far, Pakistan is being blamed for all that is happening in Afghanistan, and Pakistan's point of view has not been shown in the international media.' He called the attack unprovoked and said Pakistan should respond by shooting down NATO aircraft and keeping the supply lines closed. 'Those who say that Pakistan cannot afford a war with the U.S. and NATO, I think we should realize that U.S. and NATO also cannot afford a war with Pakistan.' Other analysts, including Rustam Shah Mohmand, a former ambassador to Afghanistan, said Pakistan would protest and close the supply lines for some time, but that ultimately 'things will get back to normal.'",

    "original_text": "Yet at a time when readers and advertisers are turning increasingly to the internet, where news is often free, does a newspaper, which charges 2.50 per paper edition, still have a promising future? For more than a century already the FT has been learning to roll with the times. When the Financial Times was founded through the merger of two other papers in 1888 it aimed to be the friend of \"the honest financier\" and \"the respectable broker\". It was initially a four page journal targeting city clientele. Its owners decided to turn it pink either as a stroke of marketing genius to make it stand out from its rivals or because unbleached paper was cheaper, depending on which historian you believe. Early on, a boom in South African gold mining shares helped it establish its financial niche with readers and advertisers. In 1957 the paper was taken over by then oil to media company, Pearson, which brought with it additional capital. The stock market boom of the fifties and early sixties helped boost circulation and establish it as one of the UK's national quality papers. William Rees Mogg and Nigel Lawson joined the paper and to coin Harold Macmillan's phrase Britain and the Financial Times \"had never had it so good\". As the FT expanded its coverage to include the arts and public affairs, Britain's other papers began to catch on to the advantages of publishing sections on business and finance and competition got stiffer. The paper's most difficult period came in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The UK's economy was stagnating and the print unions were making newspaper publishing tough. Yet according to John Lloyd, the paper's industrial editor at the time Arthur Scargill, leader of the striking British miners' union, used to read the FT in the morning before he turned to the communist Morning Star \"to get the facts\". The Financial Times has always had ambition to be a truly international newspaper, at one point publishing five international editions in continental Europe, the US, Asia and the Middle East. In 2000 the FT even started publishing a German language edition, Financial Times Deutschland, but it never managed to make a profit and Pearson sold the FT's 50 stake to its German partner in 2008. And now chief executive John Ridding says they're now back to producing what's essentially a single, global product. \"There's a little bit of what the editor refers to as lipstick and make up on the front page but fundamentally the same stories appear in all of our editions.\" Nowadays the newspaper forms the core of the FT Group which in 2013 made a profit of 55m, the last year its accounts were published separately. Last year, for the first time, the newspaper was profitable before advertising, that is simply on the cover price. \"The issue we all face is the issue of habit. It used to be that the FT or another paper would turn up on your doorstep,\" says chief executive John Ridding. \"With digital delivery that has all been disrupted. The challenge we face is how do you recreate that sense of habit.\" The FT has been one of the more successful paper publishers to help readers make the shift to a digital habit. Its total circulation has risen to 737,000 with digital representing 70 of that. People may not always be physically picking up the pink'un but the access to specialist information and expert analysis is enough to persuade them to part with the 5.35 a week subscription fee.",

    "original_text": "Doomed: Roberto Curti was high on drugs when he was chased by police in Sydney. He died after being held down and tasered 14 times. His chase and arrest were captured on CCTV pictured Australian police who used taser guns . repeatedly on a Brazilian student behaved with an ungoverned pack . mentality like schoolboys from the novel Lord of the Flies a coroner said . today. Roberto Curti, 21, died after he was . pinned down by police, handcuffed and hit with 14 taser shots after a late night . chase through the streets of Sydney earlier this year. In a series of scathing findings following the two week inquest in Sydney, New South Wales coroner Mary Jerram recommended that five officers involved in the struggle be considered for disciplinary charges, but stopped short of calling for a criminal investigation into their actions. No definite cause of Mr Curti s death was found during the inquest, but the coroner was told he might have choked while he was being restrained face down on the footpath after he had had capsicum spray used on him and had been hit by tasers. The coroner said that one probationary constable, Daniel Barling, who had used his taser right up against Mr Curti s shirtless body in what is known as drive stun mode five times, had shown appalling judgement and had behaved in a thuggish manner. Miss Jerram said some officers had shown an ungoverned pack mentality and acted recklessly and dangerously . Some police, she said, threw themselves into the confrontation like schoolboys in Lord of the Flies and recommended their actions be referred to the Police Integrity Commission. Lord of the Flies is the title of a classic novel by English author William Golding which tells how a group of British boys form a tribe and try to govern themselves, with savage results, after they become trapped on an island following a plane crash. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The cause of Mr Curti's death is not certain, but he may have choked while being held down on his front by the police . Crime: Mr Curti was caught on camera in a shop where he stole two packets of biscuits. The shop's owner did not think the incident worth reporting, but a woman outside raised the alarm . Chase: The Brazilian student, who had taken LSD that night, is chased through the streets by officers in Sydney . Roberto s only foes . during his ordeal were the police, said the coroner, who had heard that . the student had taken the hallucinogen drug LSD earlier, had stolen two . packets of biscuits from a shop and was in a psychotic state when the . police chase began. There was no victim other than Roberto, no member of the public who suffered an iota from his delusionary fear,' she said. Certainly he had taken an illicit drug, as has become all too common in today s society, but he was guilty of no serious offence, he was proferring no threat to anyone, there was no attempt by police to consider his mental state. The inquest heard that the manager of the shop from which the biscuits were taken considered the theft so harmless he did not call police but a cleaner outside thought she had witnessed an armed robbery and raised the alarm. Physical: Officers wrestle with Mr Curti in the middle of the road as they try to restrain him . Pinned down: The student is shown with a hand on his throat as the police pin him to the ground. It is believed he may have choked when he was rolled onto his front . Shock: He appears to have a taser gun held against his body as the police continue to try to restrain him . Miss Jerram said that none of the . taser stuns after Mr Curti was brought to the ground were justified and . that the police had been reckless, careless, dangerous and excessively . forceful. Aside . from singling out probationary constable Barling for criticism, Miss . Jerram also faulted the behaviour of the most senior officer at the . scene of the struggle, Inspector Greg Cooper. His evidence, she said, had been so self contradictory, self serving and obscure it wasn t worth repeating. 'Both his actions during the event . and his attempts to exonerate himself and blame more junior officers . afterwards are little more than contemptible, said the coroner. CCTV: Student pinned to ground and tasered. GRAPHIC CONTENT . Evidence: The area where Mr Curti was held down is cordoned off as officers collect evidence . Criticised: The coroner criticised the police officers involved for behaving with a 'pack mentality' and recommended that five be considered for disciplinary action . Handing down an open verdict on the cause of Mr Curti s death, Miss Jerram recommended an immediate review of standard operating procedures for tasers and capsicum spray. She also asked the police commissioner to consider whether probationary constables should be allowed to continue using tasers. After the findings were delivered, Mr Curti s brother in law, Michael Reynolds, said his family was still in shock. Referring to the young man they knew as their beloved Beto , Mr Reynolds called for criminal charges to be laid against police directly involved in the struggle. Nothing will ever bring Beto back, but we continue to push for those responsible to face the consequences of their appalling behaviour on that night, said Mr Reynolds.",

    "original_text": "Online: Phil Culling, 41, has become romantically involved with 19 year old Helena Skelly, who is pictured in a photo from her Twitter account . A deputy head at a leading private girls schools has been forced to resign because of an affair with a former pupil. Phil Culling, 41, has become romantically involved with 19 year old Helena Skelly, an aspiring singer who left Godolphin and Latymer school last summer. Parents at the 17,000 a year West London school received an email several days ago from headmistress Ruth Mercer, informing them Mr Culling had resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect . Mrs Mercer confronted her deputy about the relationship after one of the teenager s parents allegedly called the school upon discovering that the pair had moved in together. In the letter, the headmistress added: We both recognised that his position had become untenable and the right thing for him to do was to leave. From my point of view and that of the governors, his actions have demonstrated an unfortunate lack of judgment and a failure to uphold the responsible behaviour that we all rightly expect from our staff particularly those in leadership positions. Within minutes of his forced resignation, Mr Culling s picture had been removed from the school website, and two acting deputy heads were installed in his place. It is understood that the school decided against calling the police because staff had accepted that the romantic side of the relationship only began once Miss Skelly had left. However, sources at the school said that it was an open secret that the pair were close . One said: We all knew something was up when she was still at the school. Apparently the headmistress called the girl in to ask if anything was going on but she denied it. Duo: Miss Skelly is pictured performing a variety of pop songs while Mr Culling accompanies her on the piano . Prestigious: Miss Skelly left the 17,000 a year Godolphin and Latymer school pictured in London last year . As well as being the deputy head, Mr Culling was head of music and spent many hours helping Miss Skelly with her goal of a career in the industry. In videos posted on YouTube, Miss Skelly is seen singing a variety of well known pop songs while Mr Culling accompanies her on the piano. In the caption to one video, Miss Skelly says she wrote this song about loving someone who you shouldn t and just wanting things to be simpler . In another, she sings: I thought I had been in love, but that was until I met you. Aspiring singer: Sources at the school said it was an 'open secret' that Mr Culling and the ex pupil were close . A source claimed that one of Miss Skelly s parents called the school when they learned that their daughter was living with Mr Culling in the home of one of her elder sisters. Mr Culling s estranged wife is thought to work at the school in the development department. They have three children under the age of 13. He is understood to have left their 600,000 four bed home in Isleworth, West London, a month ago, according to neighbours. One said: Philip hasn t been around for about four weeks. I used to see him taking the kids out but not any more. And his wife has been looking very upset lately. It s a real scandal. The music teacher acted as a mentor to Miss Skelly, a gifted singer, and also sat on the school s child protection panel. Miss Skelly currently performs on the pub circuit and regularly sings at an established folk music venue in West London called the Troubadour, where Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Joni Mitchell have all appeared in the past. Last night her father Hugh Skelly said he had no idea about his daughter s relationship. The businessman said: That s a shock to me. I had no idea. Hel is my daughter, I know the school, she left last year. Alumnae: Godolphin and Latymer School, in Hammersmith, has around 750 pupils between the ages of 11 and 18. Famous alumnae include Hollywood actress Kate Beckinsale left and celebrity chef Nigella Lawson right I know him. But the affair is not anything that I know about. Godolphin and Latymer School, which is in Hammersmith, has around 750 pupils between the ages of 11 and 18. Famous alumnae include celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, Hollywood actress Kate Beckinsale, singer Sophie Ellis Bextor and TV presenter Davina McCall. Last night a spokesman for the school said: I can confirm that a teacher has resigned left the school having failed to maintain the high standards of behaviour we expect from all staff. There is nothing further to add. Both Mr Culling and Miss Skelly were unavailable for comment last night.",

    "original_text": "PUEBLO, Colo. Three siblings accused in a cross country crime spree face charges of attempted first degree murder of a peace officer in the chase, shootout and crash that ended their run from the law in southern Colorado Wednesday. Ryan Dougherty, 21, Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26 and Lee Grace Dougherty, 29, waived their rights to a formal advisement in Pueblo County Court Thursday. Another court date was set for Aug. 15. Each is being held on 1.25 million bond. According to the arrest affidavits, Dylan Dougherty fired at law enforcement officers with an AK 47 assault rifle as his half brother, Ryan, drove their white Subaru Impreza on southbound I 25 at speeds approaching 125 miles an hour. We weren t trying to hurt anyone, Lee Grace Dougherty told authorities after her arrest, according to the affidavit. We just wanted them to get back. The Doughertys' vehicle crashed at Exit 52 in Huerfano County at which point the trio tried to flee on foot. View photos from the crash scene, arrests Lee Dougherty on Flickr Lee Grace Dougherty, according to the affidavit, ran into a field armed with a machine pistol and was pursued by Walsenburg Police Chief James Chamberlain. He identified himself and ordered Lee Grace to drop the weapon, and she failed to comply with his commands, the document states. Instead...Lee Grace stopped, attempted to work the action on the pistol, and pointed the weapon directly at him. Chamberlain fired his .40 caliber handgun, striking Dougherty in the right upper thigh. She fell to the ground, dropped her weapon, and was taken into custody. I pointed the gun at the cop, she told authorities. I deserved to get shot. The Dougherty siblings had been on the run since last Tuesday when they allegedly fired shots at a law enforcement officer who attempted to pull over their vehicle in Florida. They later robbed a bank in Valdosta, Georgia, according to theFBI. Ryan Dougherty was sentenced last Monday in Volusia County, Florida, to 10 years' probation and two years of community control monitoring for sending sexually explicit text messages to an 11 year old girl he met on MySpace. The trio was captured near Walsenburg, about 90 miles south of Colorado Springs, after a short chase, officials said.

Authorities said the people who were spotted made a cash purchase at an REI outdoors store north of downtown Colorado Springs. The start of the Dougherty crime spree started on the roads in Zephryhills and ended 1,700 miles away in Colorado. By BY KEITH MORELLI The Tampa Tribune Published: August 10, 2011 After eight days of eluding a nationwide manhunt, three Pasco County siblings accused of shooting at a police officer and robbing a bank were captured Wednesday after a 100 mph chase and gunfight on a south Colorado desert, authorities said. The Colorado State Patrol said it caught the three fugitive Dougherty siblings after a pursuit and crash about 50 miles north of the New Mexico state line and 1,700 miles from the siblings home in Lachoochee. The trio was captured near Walsenburg, about 90 miles south of Colorado Springs. FBI Special Agent Steve Emmett confirmed that the two men and a woman arrested are 21 year old Ryan Edward Dougherty, 26 year old Dylan Dougherty Stanley and 29 year old Lee Grace Dougherty. The state patrol announced the capture on its Twitter feed. Short pursuit with 3 sibling fugitive from Florida ends in crash, the feed said. Two of the siblings were captured immediately, one ran. The pursuit spilled from Interstate 25 to the back door of George s Drive Inn restaurant, less than a mile away. Employees of the diner heard gunshots and saw one younger man acting strangely as he got close to the restaurant. He was trying to blend in, at first running and then walking, said a waitress who identified herself only as April. We knew that he was hiding from the cops when we saw him hiding in the bushes. He didn t look injured, because he was running, she added. We didn t see any weapon in his hand, unless he had it in his pants or something. He was just trying to get the heck out of Dodge. Restaurant workers called authorities and told them where the man was hiding. He passed right between our back door and our shed, she said of the fugitive. We re a small town. It was scary especially after we heard the gunshots. Lee Grace Dougherty ran through a field carrying an automatic pistol. She turned around and pointed the gun at a Walsenburg police officer. The officer shot her in the leg, investigators said. She was taken to a hospital with non life threatening injuries. At the scene where the Dougherty siblings were captured investigators found a MAC 11 machine pistol, two AK 47 assault rifles and a handgun outside the Subaru Impreza that the trio drove. Pasco County sheriff s detectives will travel to Colorado to question the Doughertys. The extradition process will begin as soon as possible, said Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco. Zephyrhills Police Chief David Shears said he s glad the ordeal is over. We re happy about the outcome, Shears said, that no law enforcement officers or civilians were hurt. Brendon Bookman, the fianc of Lee Grace Dougherty, said he s relieved the manhunt has ended. Thank God it is over, Bookman said. I am pleasantly surprised they are alive. They were daredevils and thrill seekers, Bookman said of the trio police dubbed the Dougherty Gang. I hope it was fun while it lasted because they are looking at some pretty boring years coming up. Bookman said plans for marrying Lee Grace Dougherty are probably over. By the time she is out of jail, I will be in a diaper, he said. Bookman said he will visit his fianc e, if she will allow it, and bring her favorite doll. The state patrol received a tip shortly after 9 a.m. Wednesday that the three were spotted near Colorado City. Their 2006 Subaru was seen at a campground, but they were gone by the time Pueblo County sheriff s deputies arrived. A deputy spotted the car at a nearby gas station in Colorado City, and a state trooper tried to pull it over. The driver refused to stop and a pursuit began, with shots from an AK 47 assault rifle being fired at troopers from the suspects vehicle, officials said. The getaway vehicle crashed after troopers dropped stop sticks in the southbound lanes of Interstate 25 near Walsenburg. Mike Lave was working in his gift shop on Main Street in Walsenburg, a town of about 4,000, when a series of police cars went zipping by. We just saw them go by the window, said Lave. We didn t know what was going on.\" The siblings are suspected of firing at least 20 shots on Aug. 2 at a Zephyrhills officer who tried to pull them over for speeding. The officer, who was not injured, did not return fire but gave chase. The Subaru reached speeds of 103 mph before the pursuit ended at State Road 54 and Morris Bridge Road when a bullet struck the patrol car's front left tire. Investigators linked the siblings to the case after they found Ryan Dougherty's ankle monitor near the scene of the car chase. He had just been issued the monitor after being convicted of sending sexually explicit text messages to an 11 year old girl. Hours later, three people wearing masks robbed a bank in Valdosta, Ga., about 210 miles north of Pasco County. One robber brandished an AK 47 assault rifle while another was photographed by a security camera waving some type of machine gun, said the FBI, which named the Doughertys as suspects. Nocco said all three had been living together in Lachoochee, and each had legal issues. Lee Grace Dougherty has charges pending against her in a hit and run and had previously been charged with battery, Nocco said, and Dylan Dougherty Stanley had been charged with marijuana possession. Nocco said the Subaru belongs to Ryan Dougherty's girlfriend, who helped authorities identify the car.",
